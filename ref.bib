Abstract = {Efforts to use microwaves in material processing are gradually
   increasing. However, the phenomena associated with the processing are
   less understood; popular mechanisms such as dipolar heating and
   conduction heating have been mostly explored. The current paper reviews
   most of the significant phenomena that cause heating during
   microwave-material interaction and heat transfer during microwave energy
   absorption in materials. Mechanisms involved during interaction of
   microwave with characteristically different materials - metals,
   non-metals and composites (metal matrix composites, ceramic matrix
   composites and polymer matrix composites) have been discussed using
   suitable illustrations. It was observed that while microwave heating of
   metal based materials is due to the magnetic field based loss effects,
   dipolar loss and conduction loss are the phenomena associated with the
   electric field effects in microwave heating of non-metals. Challenges in
   processing of advanced materials, particularly composites have been
   identified from the available literature; further research directions
   with possible benefits have been highlighted. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

   production of composites reinforced by nano-ceramic particles such as
   carbides, nitrides, oxides as well as carbon nanotubes. The main issue
   of concern for the synthesis of these materials consists in the low
   wettability of the reinforcement phase by the molten metal, which does
   not allow the synthesis by conventional casting methods. Several
   alternative routes have been presented in literature for the production

Abstract = {Graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs) exhibit ultra-high strength and elastic
   modulus. Therefore, they are potential ideal reinforcements in
   metal-matrix composites (MMCs). In this work, we report the use of GNPs
   to strengthen the bulk Cu-matrix composites. GNP reinforced Cu-matrix
   (GNP/Cu) composites were prepared by a combination of the ball milling
   and hot-pressing processing, and their mechanical properties were
   investigated. Microstructure studies indicated that the GNPs with
   0-8vol.\% contents were well dispersed in the Cu matrix by ball milling.
   Compared to unreinforced Cu, the GNP/Cu composites showed a remarkable
   increase in yield strength and Young's modulus up to 114 and 37\% at
   8vol.\% GNP content, respectively. The extraordinary reinforcement is
   attributed to the homogeneous dispersion of GNPs and grain refinement.
   However, the mechanical improvement of GNP/Cu composites was still below
   the theoretical value. The possible reasons for this deviation were
   discussed and the methods for further mechanical improvement of GNP/Cu
   composites were proposed. (C) 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co. KGaA,

Abstract = {Graphene has an ultra-high thermal conductivity (TC) along its basin
   plane. However, the TC of graphene/metal composites is still far below
   the expectation due primarily to the lack of sufficient graphene
   alignment in the metal matrix. Herein, we reported an efficient route to
   prepare the graphene nanoplatelet (GNP)/Cu composites with highly
   aligned GNPs by a vacuum filtration method followed by spark plasma
   sintering. Impressively, when the GNP fraction reached 35 vol\%, a
   long-range and highly aligned GNP network was established within the Cu
   matrix, leading to a surprisingly high in-plane TC of 525 W/mK, which
   was 50\% higher than that of Cu matrix and among the highest value ever
   reported for bulk graphene/metal composites. These results demonstrated
   that our strategy to construct a highly aligned graphene network could
   indeed achieve the remarkable in-plane TC enhancement in graphene/metal
   composites, and resulting composites may find application in electronic
   packaging that requires efficient directional heat transfer. (C) 2017

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {This paper provides a comprehensive review of literature, mostly of the
   last 10-15 years, on modeling of machining of composite materials with a
   focus on the process of turning. The paper discusses modeling of both
   fiber reinforced and particle reinforced composites. Modeling studies
   include molecular dynamic simulations, 2-D and 3-D finite element models
   and the emerging field of multiscale models. In fiber reinforced
   composites the focus is on glass and carbon fiber reinforced polymeric
   composites as well as long fiber reinforced metal matrix composites. On
   the other hand modeling of particulate composites is restricted to that
   of metal matrix composites (MMC). The paper includes recent modeling
   work to predict cutting forces, tool-particle interaction, cutting
   temperatures and machined sub-surface damage. A case study on the
   machining of the MMC A359 aluminum matrix composite reinforced with 20\%
   by volume fraction silicon carbide particles is included to showcase the
   hierarchical multi-scale machining model. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {One-dimensional carbon nanotubes and two-dimensional graphene nanosheets
   with unique electrical, mechanical and thermal properties are attractive
   reinforcements for fabricating light weight, high strength and high
   performance metal-matrix composites. Rapid advances of nanotechnology in
   recent years enable the development of advanced metal matrix
   nanocomposites for structural engineering and functional device
   applications. This review focuses on the recent development in the
   synthesis, property characterization and application of aluminum,
   magnesium, and transition metal-based composites reinforced with carbon
   nanotubes and graphene nanosheets. These include processing strategies
   of carbonaceous nanomaterials and their composites, mechanical and
   tribological responses, corrosion, electrical and thermal properties as
   well as hydrogen storage and electrocatalytic behaviors. The effects of
   nanomaterial dispersion in the metal matrix and the formation of
   interfacial precipitates on these properties are also addressed.
   Particular attention is paid to the fundamentals and the
   structure-property relationships of such novel nanocomposites. (C) 2013

Abstract = {The necessity for high performance and low-cost materials caused the
   researchers worldwide to switch the focus from monolithic to composite
   materials. In the recent pasts, a significant effort has been made in
   this direction to fabricate numerous combinations of metal matrix
   composites. Among the MMCs, aluminum-based composites are treated as the
   most promising structural materials due to their high corrosion, wear
   resistance, specific modulus, and weight for automobile and aerospace
   applications. Aluminum MMCs were produced by various fabrication process
   after considering different reinforcement particles, such as borides,
   carbides, oxides, nitrides, and their combinations. Aluminum MMCs
   revealed excellent mechanical and wear characteristics owing to the
   formation of stable reinforcement particles in the composites. In the
   present review article, recent advances in processing, microstructure,
   wear, and mechanical characterization of aluminum composites reinforced
   with different particles are addressed. The future scope of these
   composites is also briefly discussed at the end of the manuscript.},

Abstract = {Stir casting is one of the most suitable processes for producing Metal
   Matrix Composites (MMCs) because of its simplicity, proven process,
   lower cost of production and mass production capability. This paper
   reviews all the significant attributes of stir casting process such as
   furnace design, properties of the composites, challenges in the
   production of the composites as well as the potential research
   opportunities in the production of composites. We have also provided
   recommendations for the furnace design, selection of matrix and
   reinforcement materials as well as process parameters and additives,
   which makes the review novel. In order to provide a background for any
   reader interested in the production processes for MMCs, we have also
   discussed the various approaches in the introductory section briefly.
   Based on the critical assessment of the literature, especially the
   mechanical properties of the produced MMCs, a bottom tapping stir
   casting furnace, preferably with electromagnetic and ultrasonic stirrer
   along with squeeze attachment is recommended for the production of MMCs.},

Abstract = {Significant progress has been made in magnesium-based composites during
   recent decades, especially for the appearance of magnesium matrix
   composite reinforced by nanoparticles. The nanoparticles added not only
   exhibit a good strengthening effect, but also maintain the initial
   toughness of the matrix, effectively balancing the contradiction between
   the strength and plasticity in the traditional magnesium matrix
   composites. The magnesium matrix nanocomposites with excellent
   mechanical properties have pushed the development of magnesium matrix
   composites to a new stage. However, it is very difficult to disperse the
   nanoparticles in metal melt especially in magnesium melt which is
   different from other metal melts and dangerous during the cast
   processing. This means that the preparation of magnesium matrix
   nanocomposite is extremely challenging. Further, the magnesium matrix
   nanocomposites possess a distinctive characteristic in deformation
   behavior, strengthening and toughening mechanism due to their special
   size effect of nanoparticles. Accordingly, this review will focus on the
   new preparation technologies, deformation behavior, mechanical
   properties and strengthening and toughening mechanisms. The potential
   applications, development trends and future research ideas of magnesium
   matrix nanocomposite are also prospected. (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier

   composites present a poor lubricating behavior not related to
   environmental parameters or surface properties, but due to the simple
   fact that the solid lubricant added is not there anymore, i.e. it has
   reacted with the matrix or other additives. This review compiled
   publications from 1945 up to 2017 about the research developments in
   metal matrix self-lubricating composites containing MoS2. Information on

Abstract = {Graphene (Gr) and its derivatives (such as graphene oxide ( GO), reduced
   graphene oxide (RGO), nano-particles decorated graphene, etc.)
   reinforced metal matrix composites (MMC) with good structural mechanical
   properties and functional properties have wide applications in
   aerospace, automotive, electronics and military fields. However, some
   problems exist in preparing high performance MMC including poor
   wettability between Gr-type fillers and metal matrix, and weak
   interfacial bonding strength. Efficient methods for preparing Gr-related
   nanomaterials filling metal matrix parts with high performance,
   especially for complex parts still need be further developed. The
   engineering application field of Gr MMC needs to be further expanded. In
   this paper, methods to prepare high performance MMC including surface
   modification of Gr and its derivatives, properties and applications of
   these reinforced MMC were reviewed with detailed examples. The main
   challenges were analyzed and the development trend of Gr-type types
   reinforced MMC was discussed. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   for stable lithium metal batteries},

Abstract = {Lithium (Li) metal with an ultrahigh specific theoretical capacity and
   the lowest reduction potential is strongly considered as a promising
   anode for high-energy-density batteries. However, uncontrolled lithium
   dendrites and infinite volume change during repeated plating/stripping
   cycles hinder its practical applications immensely. Herein, a house-like
   Li anode (housed Li) was designed to circumvent the above issues. The
   house matrix was composed of carbon fiber matrix and affords a stable
   structure to relieve the volume change. An artificial solid electrolyte
   layer was formed on composite Li metal, just like the roof of a house,
   which facilitates uniform Li ions diffusion and serves as a physical
   barrier against electrolyte corrosion. With the combination of solid
   electrolyte layer and matrix in the composite Li metal anode, both
   dendrite growth and volume expansion are remarkably inhibited. The
   housed Li vertical bar LiFePO4 batteries exhibited over 95\% capacity
   retention after 500 cycles at 1.0 C in coin cell and 85\% capacity
   retention after 80 cycles at 0.5 C in pouch cell. The rationally
   combination of solid electrolyte layer protection and housed framework
   in one Li metal anode sheds fresh insights on the design principle of a
   safe and long-lifespan Li metal anode for Li metal batteries. (C) 2018

Abstract = {The development of an effective method for detecting heavy-metal ions
   remains a serious task because of their high toxicity to public health
   and environments. Herein, a new electrochemical method based on a
   graphene aerogel (GA) and metal-organic framework (MOF) composites was
   developed for simultaneous detection of multiple heavy-metal ions in
   aqueous solutions. The GA-MOF composites were synthesized via the in
   situ growth of the MOF UiO-66-NH2 crystal on the GA matrix. GA not only
   serves as the backbone for UiO-66-NH2 but also enhances the conductivity
   of the composites by accelerating the electron transfer in the matrix.
   UiO-66-NH2 worked as a binding site for heavy-metal ions because of the
   interaction between hydrophilic groups and metal cations. The detection
   performance of the GA-UiO-66-NH2 composite-modified electrodes was
   determined. The developed electrochemical method can be successfully
   applied for individual and simultaneous detection of heavy-metal ions,
   namely, Cd2+, Pb2+, Cu2+, and Hg2+, in aqueous solutions with high
   sensitivity and selectivity. The method can also be used for
   simultaneous detection of Cd2+, Pb2+, Cu2+, and Hg2+ in river water and
   the leaching solutions of soil and vegetable with high accuracy and
   reliability. This work provides a new approach for simultaneous
   detection of multiple heavy-metal ions in practical applications.},

  abstract                   = {Since the 1960s, it has been a common practice worldwide to pursue a
   homogeneous distribution of reinforcements within a matrix material,
   discontinuous metal matrix composites (DMMCs) in particular. Taking an
   overview of the worldwide activities in DMMC research, despite many
   favourable attributes such as improved specific strength, stiffness and
   superior wear resistance, DMMCs with a homogeneous microstructure tend
   to exhibit a very low room temperature damage tolerance even with a
   highly ductile matrix material such as aluminium. In this review, a
   range of uniquely multi-scale hierarchical structures have been
   successfully designed and fabricated by tailoring reinforcement
   distribution for DMMCs in order to obtain superior performance. A
   variety of specific microstructures that were developed in Al, Mg, Cu,
   Fe, Co and TiAl matrices indicate that there must be adequate plastic
   regions among the reinforcements to blunt or deflect cracks if one wants
   to toughen DMMCs. Following this path, aided by theoretical analyses,
   the most recent success is the design and fabrication of a network
   distribution of in situ reinforcing TiB whiskers (TiBw) in titanium
   matrix composites (TMCs), where a tailored three-dimensional (3D)
   quasi-continuous network microstructure displays significant
   improvements in mechanical properties. This resolves the brittleness
   surrounding TMCs fabricated by powder metallurgy. It is the large
   reinforcement-lean regions that remarkably improve the composite's
   ductility by bearing strain, blunting the crack and decreasing the
   crack-propagation rate. The fracture, strengthening and toughening
   mechanisms are comprehensively elucidated in order to further understand
   the advantages of such an inhomogeneous microstructure, and to justify
   the development of novel techniques to produce such inhomogeneous
   microstructures. This approach opens up a new horizon of research and
   applications of DMMCs and can be easily extended to general multiphase
   composites with enhanced physical and mechanical properties. (C) 2015

Abstract = {With the widespread application of electronic communication technology,
   the resulting electromagnetic radiation pollution has been significantly
   increased. Metal matrix electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding
   materials have disadvantages such as high density, easy corrosion,
   difficult processing and high price, etc. Polymer matrix EMI shielding
   composites possess light weight, corrosion resistance and easy
   processing. However, the current polymer matrix composites present
   relatively low electrical conductivity and poor EMI shielding
   performance. This review firstly discusses the key concept, loss
   mechanism and test method of EMI shielding. Then the current development
   status of EMI shielding materials is summarized, and the research
   progress of polymer matrix EMI shielding composites with different
   structures is illustrated, especially for their preparation methods and
   evaluation. Finally, the corresponding key scientific and technical
   problems are proposed, and their development trend is also prospected.},

Abstract = {Composites incorporating ferromagnetic metal nanopartices into a highly
   porous carbon matrix are promising as electromagnetic wave absorption
   materials. Such special composite nanomaterials are potentially prepared
   by the thermal decomposition of metal-organic framework (MOF) materials
   under controlled atmospheres. In this study, using Co-based MOFs
   (Co-MOF, ZIF-67) as an example, the feasibility of this synthetic
   strategy was demonstrated by the successful fabrication of porous Co/C
   composite nanomaterials. The atmosphere and temperature for the thermal
   decomposition of MOF precursors were crucial factors for the formation
   of the ferromagnetic metal nanopartices and carbon matrix in the porous
   Co/C composites. Among the three Co/C composites obtained at different
   temperatures, Co/C-500 obtained at 500 degrees C exhibited the best
   performance for electromagnetic wave absorption. In particular, the
   maximum reflection loss (RL) of Co/C-500 reached -35.3 dB, and the
   effective absorption bandwidth (RL  pound -10 dB) was 5.80 GHz (8.40
   GHz-14.20 GHz) corresponding to an absorber thickness of 2.5 mm. Such
   excellent electromagnetic wave absorption properties are ascribed to the
   synergetic effects between the highly porous structure and multiple
   components, which significantly improved impedance matching.},

Abstract = {Nanoporous carbon decorated with Fe nanoparticles (Fe/C) was prepared
   via in situ carbonization of Fe precursor-encapsulated Zn-based metal
   organic framework (ZIF8). In the synthetic process, iron precursor
   (ferrous salt) was mechanically mixed with pre-synthesized ZIF8 taking
   advantage of the porous characteristic of ZIF8, and then converted to Fe
   nanoparticles (NPs) at high temperature. The Fe NPs with low content and
   small size were uniformly embedded in porous graphitic carbon matrix.
   When the filler loading of Fe/C composite is as low as 15 wt\% in
   paraffin matrix, the absorber exhibited a minimum reflection loss of
   -29.5 dB at a thickness of 2.5 mm, The strong absorbing capability
   together with the lightweight feature is closely associated with the
   well-designed constituent and structure of the composite, which result
   in good impedance matching and strong electromagnetic energy loss due to
   the dual-loss mechanism and the synergistic effect between Fe NPs and
   carbon matrix. This study not only provides a lightweight
   electromagnetic wave absorbing material, but also offers a general way
   to prepare metal NPs-nanoporous carbon composite absorber. (C) 2016

Abstract = {Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are a class of crystallized porous
   polymeric materials consisting of metal ions or clusters linked together
   by organic bridging ligands. Due to their permanent porosity, rich
   surface chemistry and tuneable pore sizes, MOFs have emerged as one type
   of important porous solid and have attracted intensive interests in
   catalysis, gas adsorption, separation and storage over the past two
   decades. When compared with pure MOFs, the combination of MOFs with
   functional species or matrix materials not only shows enhanced
   properties, but also broadens the applications of MOFs in new fields,
   such as bio-imaging, drug delivery and electrical catalysis, owing to
   the interactions of the functional species/matrix with the MOF
   structures. Although the synthesis, chemical modification and potential
   applications of MOFs have been reviewed previously, there is an
   increasing awareness on the synthesis and applications of their
   composites, which have rarely been reviewed. This review aims to fill
   this gap and discuss the fabrication, properties, and applications of
   MOF composites. The remaining challenges and future opportunities in
   this field, in terms of processing techniques, maximizing composite
   properties, and prospects for applications, have also been indicated.},

  abstract                   = {The integration of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with polymer fibres
   enables the formation of fibrous composite materials with advantages
   over traditional single-component polymer films and mixed-matrix
   membranes. In comparison with mixed-matrix membranes, MOF-polymer
   fibrous composites offer improved molecular transport through the
   material and easier access to the active sites of MOFs. These attributes
   make fibrous composites appealing for clothing, personal protective
   equipment, air purification and filtration, biomedical equipment and
   delivery of therapeutics, along with detection and sensing applications.
   In this Review, we outline approaches for the incorporation of MOFs
   into, or onto, polymer fibres and present some applications for
   MOF-polymer fabrics. The integration of MOFs and polymers can either
   occur prior to fibre formation (namely, MOF-first), via particle
   deposition (resulting in either covalent or non-covalent attachment) of
   MOFs to the fibre or by in situ MOF growth after fibre formation
   (namely, fibre-first). We focus on the structure-processing-activity
   relationships - for example, MOF loading, MOF crystal size, polymer
   concentration and processing parameters - that impact the behaviour of
   fibrous composites. We conclude with a discussion of research avenues
   that can advance this burgeoning field.
   Composites made from metal-organic frameworks and polymer fibres are
   gaining popularity in many applications because of their tailorable
   morphologies and properties. This Review summarizes various methods for
   fabricating these composites, explores structure-processing-activity
   relationships and discusses future research opportunities.},

Abstract = {In the present work, we studied the effect of the aspect ratio of carbon
   nanotubes (CNTs) on strengthening aluminum metal matrix composites (Al
   MMCs). To this end, Al samples reinforced with CNTs of various aspect
   ratios were produced via three different powder metallurgy methods.
   Microstructural examination revealed that the CNTs were uniformly
   dispersed in the materials with a range of aspect ratios from 6.5 to 55.
   The tensile results showed that the CNTs exhibited a strong
   strengthening effect in the composites regardless of their aspect
   ratios. However, the post-loading examination and quantitative analysis
   indicated that there was a strengthening mechanism transition for CNTs,
   which was closely associated with the aspect ratio or length of CNTs.
   The origin of such transition was explored from the viewpoint of
   dislocation-CNTs interaction under loading. The findings may provide a
   new insight in understanding the strengthening behaviors of
   CNT-reinforced MMCs. (C) 2017 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {Metals, such as copper and silver, can be extremely toxic to bacteria at
   exceptionally low concentrations. Because of this biocidal activity,
   metals have been widely used as antimicrobial agents in a multitude of
   applications related with agriculture, healthcare, and the industry in
   general. Unlike other antimicrobial agents, metals are stable under
   conditions currently found in the industry allowing their use as
   additives. Today these metal based additives are found as: particles,
   ions absorbed/exchanged in different carriers, salts, hybrid structures,
   etc. One recent route to further extend the antimicrobial applications
   of these metals is by their incorporation as nanoparticles into polymer
   matrices. These polymer/metal nanocomposites can be prepared by several
   routes such as in situ synthesis of the nanoparticle within a hydrogel
   or direct addition of the metal nanofiller into a thermoplastic matrix.
   The objective of the present review is to show examples of polymer/metal
   composites designed to have antimicrobial activities, with a special
   focus on copper and silver metal nanoparticles and their mechanisms.},

Abstract = {Rapid innovation in nanotechnology in recent years enabled development
   of advanced metal matrix nanocomposites for structural engineering and
   functional devices. Carbonous materials, such as graphite, carbon
   nanotubes (CNT's), and graphene possess unique electrical, mechanical,
   and thermal properties. Owe to their lubricious nature, these carbonous
   materials have attracted researchers to synthesize lightweight
   self-lubricating metal matrix nanocomposites with superior mechanical
   and tribological properties for several applications in automotive and
   aerospace industries. This review focuses on the recent development in
   mechanical and tribological behavior of self-lubricating metallic
   nanocomposites reinforced by carbonous nanomaterials such as CNT and
   graphene. The review includes development of self-lubricating
   nanocomposites, related issues in their processing, their
   characterization, and investigation of their tribological behavior. The
   results reveal that adding CNT and graphene to metals decreases both
   coefficient of friction and wear rate as well as increases the tensile
   strength. The mechanisms involved for the improved mechanical and
   tribological behavior is discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

  abstract                   = {Composites incorporating two-dimensional nanostructures within polymeric
   matrices have potential as functional components for several
   technologies, including gas separation. Prospectively, employing
   metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) as versatile nanofillers would notably
   broaden the scope of functionalities. However, synthesizing MOFs in the
   form of freestanding nanosheets has proved challenging. We present a
   bottom-up synthesis strategy for dispersible copper
   1,4-benzenedicarboxylate MOF lamellae of micrometre lateral dimensions
   and nanometre thickness. Incorporating MOF nanosheets into polymer
   matrices endows the resultant composites with outstanding CO2 separation
   performance from CO2/CH4 gas mixtures, together with an unusual and
   highly desired increase in the separation selectivity with pressure. As
   revealed by tomographic focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy,
   the unique separation behaviour stems from a superior occupation of the
   membrane cross-section by the MOF nanosheets as compared with isotropic
   crystals, which improves the efficiency of molecular discrimination and
   eliminates unselective permeation pathways. This approach opens the door
   to ultrathin MOF-polymer composites for various applications.},

Abstract = {Titanium matrix composites (TMCs) offer high specific strength and
   stiffness compared with steel and nickel-base materials.
   High-temperature TMCs can offer up to 50\% weight reduction relative to
   monolithic superalloys while maintaining equivalent strength and
   stiffness in jet engine propulsion systems. Regardless of the
   reinforcements are continuous fibres or discontinuous particulates, the
   unique properties of TMCs have thrust them to the forefront of extensive
   research and development programmes around the world. Even though TMCs
   are one of the most studied and sought-after material systems, useful
   information about their properties, fabrication methods and design is
   scattered in the literature. This review covers important research work
   that has led to the advances in TMCs material systems. It also provides
   comprehensive details about common reinforcements, manufacturing
   processes, and reviews static and dynamic properties of some common
   TMCs. The review also presents common industrial applications of TMCs
   and highlights the promising outlook of TMCs.},

Title = {Uniform and stable immobilization of metal-organic frameworks into
   chitosan matrix for enhanced tetracycline removal from water},
Journal = {CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {382},
Month = {FEB 15},
Abstract = {Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have been attractive adsorbents for the
   treatment of antibiotic wastewater. However, in their powder form, the
   adsorbents suffer from the disadvantage of poor recyclability and
   complex operational process. Herein, we incorporated typical MOFs
   (ZIF-8, ZIF-67, HKUST-1, and Fe-BTC) into low-cost chitosan matrix for
   the tetracycline removal. Metal hydroxide(or metal oxide)/chitosan
   composite beads from the metal salt/chitosan solution were used as MOF
   precursor, which lead to the uniform and stable MOF loading into
   chitosan. This composition could not only shape MOFs into beads but also
   improve the adsorption capacity of the chitosan. As a result,
   ZIF-8-chitosan composite beads exhibited good adsorption performance
   toward antibiotic tetracycline. The adsorption processes followed
   pseudo-second-order model and Langmuir isotherm model. The maximum
   adsorption capacity could reach 495.04 mg/g, which is higher than most
   of the MOF-based or natural polymer-based tetracycline adsorbents.
   Moreover, the removal efficiency of ZIF-8-chitosan composite beads
   toward tetracycline was still above 90\% after ten adsorption-desorption
   cycles. In the fixed-bed experiment, ZIF-8-chitosan column could treat
   similar to 887 bed volumes (BV) of tetracycline solution in real water
   sample. Both experimental characterizations and DFT calculations
   indicated that the adsorption mechanism involves in the electrostatic
   interaction, pi-pi stacking interaction and hydrogen-bonding
   interaction. This study provides a promising strategy for uniform MOF
   loading into the matrix and potential adsorbents for pharmaceutical
   wastewater treatment.},

   produce complex shaped functional metallic components, including metals,
   alloys and metal matrix composites (MMCs), to meet demanding
   requirements from aerospace, defence, automotive and biomedical
   industries. Laser sintering (LS), laser melting (LM) and laser metal
   deposition (LMD) are presently regarded as the three most versatile AM
   processes. Laser based AM processes generally have a complex
   non-equilibrium physical and chemical metallurgical nature, which is
   material and process dependent. The influence of material
   characteristics and processing conditions on metallurgical mechanisms
   and resultant microstructural and mechanical properties of AM processed
   components needs to be clarified. The present review initially defines
   LS/LM/LMD processes and operative consolidation mechanisms for metallic
   components. Powder materials used for AM, in the categories of pure
   metal powder, prealloyed powder and multicomponent metals/alloys/MMCs
   powder, and associated densification mechanisms during AM are addressed.
   An in depth review is then presented of material and process aspects of
   AM, including physical aspects of materials for AM and microstructural
   and mechanical properties of AM processed components. The overall
   objective is to establish a relationship between material, process, and
   metallurgical mechanism for laser based AM of metallic components.},

   ``nanotubes on microrods{''} matrix exhibited strong magnetic loss
   capability, confirmed by off-axis electron holography.Hierarchical
   Mo2N@CoFe@C/CNT composites displayed remarkable microwave absorption
   value of -53.5 dB. AbstractHierarchical magnetic-dielectric composites
   are promising functional materials with prospective applications in
   microwave absorption (MA) field. Herein, a three-dimension hierarchical
   ``nanotubes on microrods,{''} core-shell magnetic metal-carbon composite
   is rationally constructed for the first time via a fast metal-organic
   frameworks-based ligand exchange strategy followed by a carbonization
   treatment with melamine. Abundant magnetic CoFe nanoparticles are
   embedded within one-dimensional graphitized carbon/carbon nanotubes
   supported on micro-scale Mo2N rod (Mo2N@CoFe@C/CNT), constructing a
   special multi-dimension hierarchical MA material. Ligand exchange
   reaction is found to determine the formation of hierarchical
   magnetic-dielectric composite, which is assembled by dielectric Mo2N as
   core and spatially dispersed CoFe nanoparticles within C/CNTs as shell.
   Mo2N@CoFe@C/CNT composites exhibit superior MA performance with maximum
   reflection loss of -53.5 dB at 2 mm thickness and show a broad effective
   absorption bandwidth of 5.0 GHz. The Mo2N@CoFe@C/CNT composites hold the
   following advantages: (1) hierarchical core-shell structure offers
   plentiful of heterojunction interfaces and triggers interfacial
   polarization, (2) unique electronic migration/hop paths in the
   graphitized C/CNTs and Mo2N rod facilitate conductive loss, (3) highly
   dispersed magnetic CoFe nanoparticles within ``tubes on rods{''} matrix
   build multi-scale magnetic coupling network and reinforce magnetic
   response capability, confirmed by the off-axis electron holography.},

   Nanocomposites for High Performance Li and Na Ion Battery Anodes},

Abstract = {Carbon-oxide and carbon-sulfide nanocomposites have attracted tremendous
   interest as the anode materials for Li and Na ion batteries. Such
   composites are fascinating as they often show synergistic effect
   compared to their singular components. Carbon nanomaterials are often
   used as the matrix due to their high conductivity, tensile strength, and
   chemical stability under the battery condition. Metal oxides and
   sulfides are often used as active material fillers because of their
   large capacity. Numerous works have shown that by taking one step
   further into fabricating nanocomposites with rational structure design,
   much better performance can be achieved. The present review aims to
   present and discuss the development of carbon-based nanocomposite anodes
   in both Li ion batteries and Na ion batteries. The authors introduce the
   individual components in the composites, i.e., carbon matrices (e.g.,
   carbon nanotube, graphene) and metal oxides/sulfides; followed by
   evaluating how advanced nanostructures benefit from the synergistic
   effect when put together. Particular attention is placed on strategies
   employed in fabricating such composites, with examples such as
   yolk-shell structure, layered-by-layered structure, and composite
   comprising one or more carbon matrices. Lastly, the authors conclude by
   highlighting challenges that still persist and their perspective on how
   to further develop the technologies.},

  abstract                   = {Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are an emerging class of porous
   materials with well-defined pore and crystal structure, favorable
   biocompatibility, good chemo-/machinal stability and high surface area,
   which endow them as ideal host matrix to develop enzyme@MOF composites.
   Most of the enzyme@MOF composites exhibit excellent catalysis
   performances performance and increased stability. In the past decade,
   many efforts have been made to develop enzyme@MOF composites with
   potential applications. The dimensionality of the MOFs has a significant
   effect on the catalytic performance of enzyme@MOF composites. However,
   there have been few reviews on enzyme@MOF composites with different
   dimensionalities. This review aims to describe the contemporary advances
   in the development of enzyme@MOF composites with different
   dimensionalities. Synthesizing strategies of enzyme@MOF composites with
   different dimensionalities are summarized. The interaction between
   enzymes and MOFs with different dimensionalities from the aspects of
   activity, stability, and reusability are discussed. Furthermore, the
   application and potential research direction of enzyme@MOF composites
   are introduced. We believe this work will be helpful for readers to
   understand the fundamental research and applications of enzyme@MOF
   composites with different dimensionalities. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All

   synthesis and applications},
Journal = {CHEMICAL SOCIETY REVIEWS},

Volume = {43},

Pages = {4470-4493},
Abstract = {Zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs), a subclass of metal organic
   frameworks, are built of tetrahedral metal ions bridged by imidazolates.
   They have permanent porosity and relatively high thermal and chemical
   stability, which make them attractive candidates for many industrial
   applications. In recent years, significant progress has been made in
   developing ZIFs into membranes and thin films for gas separation, liquid
   separation (pervaporation) and functional devices. Various techniques,
   such as direct synthesis, secondary synthesis, reactive seeding and
   functional chemicals as linkers, and contra-diffusion synthesis, have
   been reported for the fabrication of ZIF membranes and films. As ZIFs
   have good compatibility with polymers, they have been incorporated into
   polymers with high loadings to form mixed matrix membranes. The
   resulting symmetric dense or asymmetric composite membranes exhibit good
   performance in gas separation and liquid separation via pervaporation.
   The recent developments of ZIF membranes/films, ZIF-polymer mixed matrix
   membranes and their applications are reviewed in this article.},

   Mixed-matrix membranes, combining processable polymers and selective
   adsorbents, offer the potential to deploy adsorbent distinct separation
   properties into processable matrix. We report the rational design and
   construction of a highly efficient, mixed-matrix metal-organic framework
   membrane based on three interlocked criteria: (i) a fluorinated
   metal-organic framework, AlFFIVE-1-Ni, as a molecular sieve adsorbent
   that selectively enhances hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide diffusion
   while excluding methane; (ii) tailoring crystal morphology into
   nanosheets with maximally exposed (001) facets; and (iii) in-plane
   alignment of (001) nanosheets in polymer matrix and attainment of
   {[}001]-orientedmembrane. The membrane demonstrated exceptionally high
   hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide separation from natural gas under
   practical working conditions. This approach offers great potential to
   translate other key adsorbents into processable matrix.},

Abstract = {Carbon nanotubes (CNTs)/aluminum (Al) composites with various
   interfacial reaction degrees were fabricated by powder metallurgy at
   sintering temperature range of 700-900 K (75-96\% melting point of Al).
   Interfacial reaction product, aluminum carbide (Al4C3), was formed in Al
   matrix composites (AMCs) reinforced by homogeneously-dispersed CNTs.
   Microscopy observations revealed three types of temperature-dependent
   interfaces, i) clean CNT-Al interfaces without interfacial carbide, ii)
   CNT-Al4C3-Al interfaces for partially reacted CNTs with Al4C3
   nanoparticles, and iii) A14C3-Al interface for in-situ Al4C3 nanorods
   evolved from completely reacted CNTs. Interfacial Al4C3 on partially
   reacted CNTs led to significant improvement of interfacial strength and
   consequent enhancement of load transfer efficiency in AMCs, compared to
   those composites without carbide. The load transfer mechanism of CNTs in
   composites was confirmed by the pull-out phenomena during in-situ
   tensile tests. The role of interfacial carbide played in determining the
   load transfer efficiency of CNTs was discussed. This study may provide
   new insights into the interfacial phenomena and load transfer mechanism
   in CNT-reinforced metal matrix composites. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

   composites that have the potentials of satisfying the recent demands of
   advanced engineering applications. These demands are met due to improved
   mechanical properties, amenability to conventional processing technique
   and possibility of reducing production cost of aluminium hybrid
   composites. The performance of these materials is mostly dependent on
   selecting the right combination of reinforcing materials since some of
   the processing parameters are associated with the reinforcing
   particulates. A few combinations of reinforcing particulates have been
   conceptualized in the design of aluminium hybrid composites. This paper
   attempts to review the different combination of reinforcing materials
   used in the processing of hybrid aluminium matrix composites and how it
   affects the mechanical, corrosion and wear performance of the materials.
   The major techniques for fabricating these materials are briefly
   discussed and research areas for further improvement on aluminium hybrid
   composites are suggested. (C) 2015 Brazilian Metallurgical, Materials

   processing (FSP) and their dependency on the processing parameters
   provides an opportunity to tailor the microstructure, and hence the
   performance of welds and surfaces to an extent not possible with fusion
   processes. While a great deal of attention has previously been focused
   on the FSW parameters and their effect on weld quality and joint
   performance, here the focus is on developing a comprehensive
   understanding of the fundamentals of the microstructural evolution
   during FSW/P. Through a consideration of the mechanisms underlying the
   development of grain structures and textures, phases, phase
   transformations and precipitation, microstructural control across a very
   wide range of similar and dissimilar material joints is examined. In
   particular, when considering the joining of dissimilar metals and
   alloys, special attention is focused on the control and dispersion of
   deleterious intermetallic compounds. Similarly, we consider how FSP can
   be used to locally refine the microstructure as well as provide an
   opportunity to form metal matrix composites (MMCs) for near surface
   reinforcement. Finally, the current gaps in our knowledge are considered
   in the context of the future outlook for FSW/P.},

   (similar to 20 nm) homogeneously anchored on a spongy carbon matrix was
   synthesized through a facile freeze-drying method and a hydrothermal
   process. As anode material for lithium/sodium ion batteries (LIBs/SIBs),
   this composite shows significantly enhanced lithium/sodium storage
   performance with the synergetic effects due to the electrical
   conductivity of the carbon matrix and the porous structure, which
   provide buffer spaces for volume expansion during charge/discharge
   processes and feasible transfer pathways for electrons/ions. The
   electrochemical results demonstrate that the spongy CoS2/carbon
   composite is an outstanding anode material for LIBs and SIBs. It
   delivers a high specific capacity of 610 mAh g(-1) at 500 mA g(-1) after
   120 cycles in LIBs and 330 mAh g(-1) at 500 mA g(-1) after 60 cycles in
   SIBs, respectively. Moreover, the freeze-drying/hydrothermal process
   developed in this work could be useful for the construction of many

   all-solid-state lithium batteries are safer and possess longer cycle
   life and have less requirements on packaging and state-of-charge
   monitoring circuits. Among various types of solid electrolytes,
   composite solid electrolytes, which are composed of active or passive
   inorganic fillers and polymer matrices, have been considered as
   promising electrolyte candidates for all-solid-state lithium batteries.
   Incorporation of inorganic fillers into the polymer matrices has been
   demonstrated as an effective method to achieve high ionic conductivity
   and excellent interfacial contact with the electrodes. In this review
   article, we first summarize the historical development of composite
   solid electrolytes. Contribution of both inert inorganic fillers and
   active Li-ion conductors to the ionic conductivity, electrochemical
   stability, and mechanical properties of the composite solid electrolytes
   are elaborated. Possible mechanisms of conductivity enhancement by
   inorganic fillers are broadly discussed. Examples of different composite
   solid electrolyte design concepts, such as inorganic
   nanoparticle/polymer, inorganic nanofiber/polymer, and other
   inorganic/polymer composite solid electrolytes, are introduced and their
   advantages and disadvantages are discussed. Inorganic filler/polymer
   composite solid electrolytes studied for use in various Li battery
   systems including Li-ion, Li-sulfur, and Li-metal batteries are
   evaluated. Promising designs of composite solid electrolytes and cathode
   materials used in all-solid-state Li batteries are also introduced.
   Finally, future perspectives on current requirements of composite solid
   electrolyte technologies are highlighted.},

Abstract = {Composite membranes typically used for gas separation are susceptible to
   interfacial voids and CO2 plasticization which adversely affects the gas
   permeation performance. This paper evaluates routes towards the
   enhancement of CO2 permeation performance and CO2 plasticization
   resistance of composite membranes using non-stoichiometric ZIF-62 MOF
   glass and cellulose acetate (CA). Single and mixed gas permeation
   results, obtained with CO2 and CH4, demonstrate that the presence of
   ZIF-62 glass in CA polymer enhanced the CO2 permeability and CO2/CH4
   ideal selectivity from 15.8 to 84.8 Barrer and 12.2-35.3, respectively.
   The composite membrane loaded with 8 wt\% of ZIF-62 glass showed the
   highest CO2 permeability and CO2/CH4 ideal selectivity of 84.8 Barrer
   and 35.3, which were 436.7\% and 189.3\% higher compared to the pristine
   CA membrane, respectively. A CO2 plasticization pressure of 26 bar was
   achieved for the composite membranes, which is 160\% higher compared to
   the pristine CA membranes, at about 10 bar. The mechanisms for the
   materials stabilization and greater separation performance were
   attributed to higher pore size (7.3 angstrom) and significant CO2
   adsorption on the unsaturated metal nodes followed by metal cites
   electrostatic interaction with CO2. These findings confirm the potential
   of ZIF-62 glass materials as promising materials solutions towards the
   design of composite membranes for CO2 separation at industrial scale.},

Title = {Selective laser melting of nano-TiB2 decorated AlSi10Mg alloy with high

Abstract = {An in-situ nano-TiB2 decorated AlSi10Mg composite (NTD-Al) powder was
   fabricated by gas-atomisation for selective laser melting (SLM). Fully
   dense and crack-free NTD-Al samples were produced using SLM. In contrast
   to the NTD-Al powder without cell-like microstructure, the SLMed NTD-Al
   had a textureless microstructure, consisting of fine grains and cells,
   with well dispersed nano-TiB2 particles inside the grains and rod-like
   nano-Si precipitates inside the cells. Both nano-TiB2 particles and
   nano-Si precipitates exhibited a highly coherent interface with the Al
   matrix, indicative of a strong interfacial bonding. The formation of
   this microstructure was attributed to the sequential solidification of
   non-equilibrium and eutectic Al-Si upon rapid cooling during SLM. As a
   result, the SLMed NTD-Al showed a very high ultimate tensile strength
   similar to 530 MPa, excellent ductility similar to 15.5\% and high
   microhardness similar to 191 HV0.3, which were higher than most
   conventionally fabricated wrought and tempered Al alloys, previously
   SLMed Al-Si alloys and nano-grained 7075 Al. The underlying mechanisms
   for this strength and ductility enhancement were discussed and a
   correlation between this novel microstructure and the superior
   mechanical properties was established. This study provides new and deep
   insights into the fabrication of metal matrix nanocomposites by SLM from
   in-situ pre-decorated composite powder. (C) 2017 Acta Materialia Inc.

Title = {Composite CD-MOF nanocrystals-containing microspheres for sustained drug

Abstract = {Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), which are typically embedded in polymer
   matrices as composites, are emerging as a new class of carriers for
   sustained drug delivery. Most of the MOFs and the polymers used so far
   in these composites, however, are not pharmaceutically acceptable. In
   the investigation reported herein, composites of gamma-cyclodextrin
   (gamma-CD)-based MOFs (CD-MOFs) and polyacrylic acid (PAA) were prepared
   by a solid in oil-in-oil (s/o/o) emulsifying solvent evaporation method.
   A modified hydrothermal protocol has been established which produces
   efficiently at 50 degrees C in 6 h micron (5-10 mu m) and nanometer
   (500-700 nm) diameter CD-MOF particles of uniform size with smooth
   surfaces and powder X-ray diffraction patterns that are identical with
   those reported in the literature. Ibuprofen (IBU) and Lansoprazole
   (LPZ), both insoluble in water and lacking in stability, were entrapped
   with high drug loading in nanometer-sized CD-MOFs by co-crystallisation
   (that is more effective than impregnation) without causing MOF crystal
   degradation during the loading process. On account of the good
   dispersion of drugloaded CD-MOF nanocrystals inside polyacrylic acid
   (PAA) matrices and the homogeneous distribution of the drug molecules
   within these crystals, the composite microspheres exhibit not only
   spherical shapes and sustained drug release over a prolonged period of
   time, but they also demonstrate reduced cell toxicity. The cumulative
   release rate for IBU (and LPZ) follows the trend: IBU-gamma-CD complex
   microspheres (ca. 80\% in 2 h) > IBU microspheres > IBU-CD-MOF/PAA
   composite microspheres (ca. 50\% in 24 h). Importantly, no burst release
   of IBU (and LPZ) was observed from the CD-MOF/PAA composite
   microspheres, suggesting an even distribution of the drug as well as
   strong drug carrier interactions inside the CD-MOF. In summary, these
   composite microspheres, composed of CD-MOF nanocrystals embedded in a
   biocompatible polymer (PAA) matrix, constitute an efficient and
   pharmaceutically acceptable MOFbased carrier for sustained drug release.},

  abstract                   = {As interfaces play a more important role in high-volume-fraction
   ceramic/metal composites because of containing more hetero-phase
   interfaces, it is a great challenge to control the interfaces in such
   composites to balance their strength and plasticity and to obtain high
   performances. In this work, 50-60 vol\% (TiC + TiB2)/Al composites were
   fabricated in Al-Ti-B4C system via a one-step method of reaction and
   densification, and their interface bonding and mechanical properties
   were compared with those of in-situ TiC/Al composites. Apparently, the
   defects, such as interfacial discontinuity, macro-pores, coarsening and
   agglomeration of particles, caused by increased ceramic content in the
   TiC/Al composites, are eliminated in the (TiC + TiB2)/Al composites
   using Al-Ti-B4C system. The 60 vol\% (TiC + TiB2)/Al composite exhibits
   significantly enhanced mechanical properties, i.e. 70.5\%, 60.7\% and
   69.8\% respectively higher yield strength, ultimate compressive strength
   and plastic strain than 60 vol\% TiC/Al composite. Such enhanced
   mechanical properties are attributed to the improvement in interface
   bonding strength and therefore the increase in the energy dissipation of
   crack propagation. The formation of enhanced interface in the (TiC +
   TiB2)/Al composites results from the reduction in the reaction heat in
   the Al-Ti-B4C system, improved crystallographic match and improved
   adhesion work between ceramic particles and matrix. This work may
   provide a new idea for the design and control of interfaces in
   high-volume-fraction ceramic-metal composites.},

Abstract = {Methods used to strengthen metals generally also cause a pronounced
   decrease in ductility and electrical conductivity. In this work a
   bioinspired strategy is applied to surmount the dilemma. By assembling
   copper submicron flakes cladded with in-situ grown graphene,
   graphene/copper matrix composites with a nanolaminated architecture
   inspired by a natural nacre have been prepared. Owing to a combined
   effect-from the bioinspired nanolaminated architecture and improved
   interfacial bonding, a synergy has been achieved between mechanical
   strength and ductility as well as electrical conductivity in the
   graphene/copper matrix composites. With a low volume fraction of only
   2.5\% of graphene, the composite shows a yield strength and elastic
   modulus similar to 177\% and similar to 25\% higher than that of
   unreinforced copper matrix, respectively, while retains ductility and
   electrical conductivity comparable to that of pure copper. The
   bioinspired nanolaminated architecture enhances the efficiencies of
   two-dimensional (2D) graphene in mechanical strengthening and electrical
   conducting by aligning graphene to maximize performance for required
   loading and carrier transporting conditions, and toughens the composites
   by crack deflection. Meanwhile, in-situ growth of graphene is beneficial
   for improving interfacial bonding and structural quality of graphene.
   The strategy sheds light on the development of composites with good
   combined structural and functional properties. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {Li-O-2 batteries represent a promising rechargeable battery candidate to
   answer the energy challenges our world is facing, thanks to their
   ultrahigh theoretical energy density. However, the poor cycling
   stability of the Li-O-2 system and, overall, important safety issues due
   to the formation of Li dendrites, combined with the use of organic
   liquid electrolytes and O-2 cross-over, inhibit their practical
   applications. As a solution to these various issues, we propose a
   composite gel polymer electrolyte consisting of a highly cross-linked
   polymer matrix, containing a dextrin-based nanosponge and activated with
   a liquid electrolyte. The polymer matrix, easily obtained by thermally
   activated one pot free radical polymerization in bulk, allows to limit
   dendrite nucleation and growth thanks to its cross-linked structure. At
   the same time, the nanosponge limits the O-2 cross-over and avoids the
   formation of crystalline domains in the polymer matrix, which, combined
   with the liquid electrolyte, allows a good ionic conductivity at room
   temperature. Such a composite gel polymer electrolyte, tested in a cell
   containing Li metal as anode and a simple commercial gas diffusion
   layer, without any catalyst, as cathode demonstrates a full capacity of
   5.05 mAh cm(-2) as well as improved reversibility upon cycling, compared
   to a cell containing liquid electrolyte.},

Abstract = {Sponge-like composites assembled by cobalt sulfides quantum dots (Co9S8
   QD), mesoporous hollow carbon polyhedral (HCP) matrix, and a reduced
   graphene oxide (rGO) wrapping sheets are synthesized by a simultaneous
   thermal reduction, carbonization, and sulfidation of zeolitic
   imidazolate frameworks@GO precursors. Specifically, Co9S8 QD with size
   less than 4 nm are homogenously embedded within HCP matrix, which is
   encapsulated in macroporous rGO, thereby leading to the double
   carbon-confined hierarchical composites with strong coupling effect.
   Experimental data combined with density functional theory calculations
   reveal that the presence of coupled rGO not only prevents the
   aggregation and excessive growth of particles, but also expands the
   lattice parameters of Co9S8 crystals, enhancing the reactivity for
   sodium storage. Benefiting from the hierarchical porosity, conductive
   network, structural integrity, and a synergistic effect of the
   components, the sponge-like composites used as binder-free anodes
   manifest outstanding sodium-storage performance in terms of excellent
   stable capacity (628 mAh g(-1) after 500 cycles at 300 mA g(-1)) and
   exceptional rate capability (529, 448, and 330 mAh g(-1) at 1600, 3200,
   and 6400 mA g(-1)). More importantly, the synthetic method is very
   versatile and can be easily extended to fabricate other
   transition-metal-sulfides-based sponge-like composites with excellent
   electrochemical performances.},

   material composed of gold nano particles (AuNPs) embedded in a bottom-up
   synthesized graphene nanoribbon (GNR) matrix for the electrocatalytic
   reduction of CO2. Electrochemical studies reveal that the structural and
   electronic properties of the GNR composite matrix increase the AuNP
   electrochemically active surface area (ECSA), lower the requisite CO2
   reduction overpotential by hundreds of millivolts (catalytic onset >-0.2
   V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)), increase the Faraday
   efficiency (>90\%), markedly improve stability (catalytic performance
   sustained over >24 h) and increase the total catalytic output (>100-fold
   improvement over traditional amorphous carbon AuNP supports). The
   inherent structural and electronic tunability of bottom-up synthesized
   GNR-AuNP composites affords an unrivaled degree of control over the
   catalytic environment, providing a means for such profound effects as
   shifting the rate-determining step in the electrocatalytic reduction of
   CO2 to CO2 and thereby altering the electrocatalytic mechanism at the
   nanoparticle surface.},

   next-generation rechargeable batteries due to its extremely high
   theoretical specific capacity and lowest reduction potential. However,
   the safety issue and short lifespan induced by uncontrolled dendrite
   growth have hindered the practical applications of lithium metal anodes.
   Hence, we propose a flexible anion-immobilized ceramic-polymer composite
   electrolyte to inhibit lithium dendrites and construct safe batteries.
   Anions in the composite electrolyte are tethered by a polymer matrix and
   ceramic fillers, inducing a uniform distribution of space charges and
   lithium ions that contributes to a dendrite-free lithium deposition. The
   dissociation of anions and lithium ions also helps to reduce the polymer
   crystallinity, rendering stable and fast transportation of lithium ions.
   Ceramic fillers in the electrolyte extend the electrochemically stable
   window to as wide as 5.5 V and provide a barrier to short circuiting for
   realizing safe batteries at elevated temperature. The anion-immobilized
   electrolyte can be applied in all-solid-state batteries and exhibits a
   small polarization of 15 mV. Cooperated with LiFePO4 and
   LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 cathodes, the all-solid-state lithium metal
   batteries render excellent specific capacities of above 150 mAh.g(-1)
   and well withstand mechanical bending. These results reveal a promising
   opportunity for safe and flexible next-generation lithium metal

Abstract = {High energy density lithium metal batteries (LMBs) are promising
   next-generation energy storage devices. However, the uncontrollable
   dendrite growth and huge volume change limit their practical
   applications. Here, a new Mg doped Li-LiB alloy with in situ formed
   lithiophilic 3D LiB skeleton (hereinafter called Li-B-Mg composite) is
   presented to suppress Li dendrite and mitigate volume change. The LiB
   skeleton exhibits superior lithiophilic and conductive characteristics,
   which contributes to the reduction of the local current density and
   homogenization of incoming Li+ flux. With the introduction of Mg, the
   composite achieves an ultralong lithium deposition/dissolution lifespan
   (500 h, at 0.5 mA cm(-2)) without short circuit in the symmetrical
   battery. In addition, the electrochemical performance is superior in
   full batteries assembled with LiCoO2 cathode and the manufactured
   composite. The currently proposed 3D Li-B-Mg composite anode may
   significantly propel the advancement of LMB technology from laboratory
   research to industrial commercialization.},

Abstract = {The thermal contact resistance (TCR) between polymer matrix composites
   (PMCs) imposes the significant impacts on the design, processing and
   application of these materials. This paper reviews the fundamental of
   the interfacial thermal conductance mechanism by analyzing the effects
   of inherent material properties, surface topography and working
   conditions of PMCs on TCR. Experimental measurement and numerical
   modeling methods are addressed to identify the distinct characteristics
   for estimating the TCR between PMCs. The main challenges for the
   accurate estimation are summarized, mainly including the complex
   interfacial thermal conductance due to the addition of fillers, the
   anisotropic thermal and mechanical responses due to the heterogeneity of
   PMCs, the uncertain contact mechanics due to the special mechanical
   properties. Finally, the multiscale estimation and machine learning
   methods are proposed for the further study on TCR between PMCs. This
   review is important because it provides guidance for the future studies
   in the interfacial thermal conductance between PMCs and thus the wide
   applications of emerging composites. (C) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {A mechanically synthesized SiO2-Fe metal matrix composite for effective
   dechlorination of aqueous 2-chlorophenol: the optimum of the preparation
   conditions},

Abstract = {In this study, abrasives-reinforced metal matrix composites (MMCs) with
   a microscale size synthesized by ball milling (BM) could achieve highly
   active and stable dechlorination efficiency for aqueous 2-chlorophenol
   (2-CP). The preparation process of this composite via BM was optimized
   to obtain a high degradation efficiency, especially for the effect of
   the abrasives including B4C, SiC, alpha-Al2O3, SiO2, Fe3O4 and Na2SO4.
   The results showed that the hardness of the abrasives in the Fe-based
   MMCs was closely related with their dechlorination performance.
   Subsequently, the optimal abrasive, i.e. SiO2 was further investigated
   for its proper milling conditions with zero-valent iron (ZVI) particles
   including optimal SiO2 size, SiO2 loading, milling time, and the dosage
   of the process control agent (PCA). Additionally, the influence of other
   metal categories including Al and Si was also investigated for
   dechlorination; and their low reaction efficiencies were closely related
   with their passivating film. Finally, the longevity test suggested that
   the decreased reactivity of the SiO2-Fe MMC during the storage in air
   could be recovered when consecutively used, mainly due to the promoting
   effects of the inherent structure of SiO2-Fe MMC with the Fe/C and
   Fe/SiO2 interfaces, as well as the effective regeneration of the
   reactive sites by continuous iron dissolution.},

Pages = {896-909},
Abstract = {Membrane technology has attracted tremendous attention in the field of
   gas separation due to its low cost and energy consumption. Polymer
   membranes are used in some industrial-scale gas separation processes,
   however, they often suffer a trade-off between permeability and
   selectivity. To overcome this limitation, porous materials with
   molecular sieve properties have been combined with polymers to give
   membranes with enhanced gas separation performance. Metal-organic
   frameworks (MOFs) are nanoporous materials possessing ultrahigh
   porosity, large surface area, structural diversity and rich
   functionalities, which make them promising candidates for gas
   separation. This review primarily focuses on the fabrication methods of
   MOF-polymer composite membranes including MOF-based mixed-matrix
   membranes (MMMs) and polymer supported MOF membranes. Recent progress in
   MOF membrane fabrication, incorporating the challenges and difficulties
   faced, are presented. Furthermore, corresponding solutions and
   strategies are given in detail to offer instructions to fabricate
   membranes with ideal morphology and performance.},

   Applications in thermal interface materials},
Journal = {APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {100},
Number = {7},
Month = {FEB 13},
Abstract = {The authors report on synthesis and thermal properties of the
   electrically conductive thermal interface materials with the hybrid
   graphene-metal particle fillers. The thermal conductivity of resulting
   composites was increased by similar to 500\% in a temperature range from
   300K to 400K at a small graphene loading fraction of 5-vol.-\%. The
   unusually strong enhancement of thermal properties was attributed to the
   high intrinsic thermal conductivity of graphene, strong graphene
   coupling to matrix materials, and the large range of the
   length-scale-from nanometers to micrometers-of the graphene and silver
   particle fillers. The obtained results are important for the thermal
   management of advanced electronics and optoelectronics. (C) 2012

Title = {Harnessing Filler Materials for Enhancing Biogas Separation Membranes},

Abstract = {Biogas is an increasingly attractive renewable resource, envisioned to
   secure future energy demands and help curb global climate change. To
   capitalize on this resource, membrane processes and state-of-the-art
   membranes must efficiently recover methane (CH4) from biogas by
   separating carbon dioxide (CO2). Composite (a.k.a. mixed-matrix)
   membranes, prepared from common polymers and rationally
   selected/engineered fillers, are highly promising for this application.
   This review comprehensively examines filler materials that are capable
   of enhancing the CO2/CH4 separation performance of polymeric membranes.
   Specifically, we highlight novel synthetic strategies for engineering
   filler materials to develop high-performance composite membranes.
   Besides, as the matrix components (polymers) of composite membranes
   largely dictate the overall gas separation performances, we introduce a
   new empirical metric, the ``Filler Enhancement Index{''} (F-index), to
   aid researchers in assessing the effectiveness of the fillers from a big
   data perspective. The F-index systematically decouples the effect of
   polymer matrices and critically evaluates both conventional and emerging
   fillers to map out a future direction for next-generation (bio)gas
   separation membranes. Beyond biogas separation, this review is of
   relevance to a broader community with interests in composite membranes
   for other gas separation processes, as well as water treatment
   applications.},

Title = {Removal of Pb(II) from aqueous solution by a zeolite-nanoscale
   zero-valent iron composite},
Journal = {CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {217},
Pages = {54-60},
Month = {FEB 1},
Abstract = {The effectiveness of nanoscale zero-valent iron (nZVI) to remove heavy
   metals from water is reduced by its low durability, poor mechanical
   strength, and tendency to form aggregates. A composite of zeolite and
   nanoscale zero-valent iron (Z-nZVI) overcomes these problems and shows
   good potential to remove Pb from water. FTIR spectra support nZVI
   loading onto the zeolite and reduced Fe-0 oxidation in the Z-nZVI
   composite. Scanning electron micrographs show aggregation was eliminated
   and transmission electron micrographs show well-dispersed nZVI in
   chain-like structures within the zeolite matrix. The mean surface area
   of the composite was 80.37 m(2)/g, much greater than zeolite (1.03
   m(2)/g) or nZVI (12.25 m(2)/g) alone, as determined by BET-N-2
   measurement. More than 96\% of the Pb(II) was removed from 100 mL of
   solution containing 100 mg Pb(II)/L within 140 min of mixing with 0.1 g
   Z-nZVI. Tests with solution containing 1000 mg Pb(II)/L suggested that
   the capacity of the Z-nZVI is about 806 mg Pb(II)/g. Energy-dispersive
   X-ray spectroscopy showed the presence of Fe in the composite; X-ray
   diffraction confirmed formation and immobilization of Fe-0 and
   subsequent sorption and reduction of some of the Pb(II) to Pb. The low
   quantity of Pb(II) recovered in water-soluble and Ca(NO3)(2)-extractable
   fractions indicate low bioavailability of the Pb(II) removed by the
   composite. Results support the potential use of the Z-nZVI composite in
   permeable reactive barriers. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {MXenes for polymer matrix electromagnetic interference shielding
   composites: A review},
Journal = {COMPOSITES COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {24},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The vigorous development of electronic equipment and wireless
   communication make the concealment and harm of electromagnetic radiation
   increasingly prominent, which seriously affects the normal operation of
   electrical equipment. Therefore, it is momentous to evolve new
   electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding materials with excellent
   comprehensive performances. In recent years, two-dimensional layered
   transition metal carbides, nitride or carbonitrides (MXenes), have
   received extensive attention in the EMI shielding field because of their
   outstanding electrical conductivity (?), hydrophilicity and chemical
   activity. This review introduces the basic performances of MXenes as
   well as their precursor MAX. Subsequently, the influences of different
   precursor MAX and fabrication methods on the structures and properties
   of MXenes are summarized. Then it focuses on the preparation methods of
   MXenes and their MXenes/polymer EMI shielding composites and their
   latest research progress. Finally, the key scientific and technical
   problems to be solved urgently in MXenes and their MXenes/ polymer EMI
   shielding composites are proposed, and the development trend of MXenes
   and their MXenes/ polymer EMI shielding composites is prospected.},

  abstract                   = {Constructing composite structures is an essential approach for obtaining
   multiple functionalities in a single entity. Available synthesis methods
   of the composites need to be urgently exploited; especially in situ
   construction. Here, a NiS/NiFe2O4 composite through a local metal-S
   coordination at the interface is reported, which is derived from phase
   reconstruction in the highly defective matrix. X-ray absorption fine
   structure confirms that long-range order is broken via the local metal-S
   coordination and, by using electron energy loss spectroscopy, the
   introduction of NiS/NiFe2O4 interfaces during the irradiation of plasma
   energy is identified. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations
   reveal that in situ phase reconfiguration is crucial for synergistically
   reducing energetic barriers and accelerating reaction kinetics toward
   catalyzing the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). As a result; it leads to
   an overpotential of 230 mV @10 mA cm(-2) for the OER and a half-wave
   potential of 0.81 V for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR); as well as
   an excellent zinc-air battery (ZAB) performance with a power density of
   148.5 mW cm(-2). This work provides a new compositing strategy in terms
   of fast phase reconstruction of bifunctional catalysts.},

Abstract = {Research into extended porous materials such as metal-organic frameworks
   (MOFs) and porous organic frameworks (POFs), as well as the analogous
   metal-organic polyhedra (MOPs) and porous organic cages (POCs), has
   blossomed over the last decade. Given their chemical and structural
   variability and notable porosity, MOFs have been proposed as adsorbents
   for industrial gas separations and also as promising filler components
   for high-performance mixed-matrix membranes (MMMs). Research in this
   area has focused on enhancing the chemical compatibility of the MOF and
   polymer phases by judiciously functionalizing the organic linkers of the
   MOF, modifying the MOF surface chemistry, and, more recently, exploring
   how particle size, morphology, and distribution enhance separation
   performance. Other filler materials, including POFs, MOPs, and POCs, are
   also being explored as additives for MMMs and have shown remarkable
   anti-aging performance and excellent chemical compatibility with
   commercially available polymers. This Review briefly outlines the
   state-of-the-art in MOF-MMM fabrication, and the more recent use of POFs
   and molecular additives.},

Abstract = {This study fabricated a new and multifunctional mixed metal-biochar
   composites (MMBC) using the mixture of two abundant industrial wastes,
   red mud (RM) and lignin, via pyrolysis under N-2 atmosphere, and its
   ability to treat wastewater containing various contaminants was
   comprehensively evaluated. A porous structure (BET surface area = 100.8
   m(2) g(-1)) was created and metallic Fe was formed in the MMBC owing to
   reduction of Fe oxides present in RM by lignin decomposition products
   during pyrolysis at 700 degrees C, which was closely associated with the
   transformation of liquid to gaseous pyrogenic products. The potential
   application of the MMBC was investigated for the removal of heavy metals
   (Pb(II) and Ni(II)), oxyanions (As(V) and Cr(VI)), dye (methylene blue),
   and pharmaceutical/personal care products (para-nitrophenol and pCBA).
   The aluminosilicate mineral, metallic Fe, and porous carbon matrix
   derived from the incorporation of RM and lignin contributed to the
   multifunctionality (i.e., adsorption, chemical reduction, and catalytic
   reaction) of the MMBC. Thus, engineered biochar composites synthesized
   from selected industrial wastes can be a potential candidate for
   environmental applications.},

   lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) in terms of its high theoretical capacity
   (755 mA h g(-1)), comparatively low voltage hysteresis (<0.8 V), low
   cost, and environmental benignity, the application of MnO as a practical
   electrode material is still hindered by many obstacles, including poor
   cycling stability and huge volume expansion during the charge/discharge
   process. Herein, we report a facile and scalable metal-organic
   framework-derived route for the in situ fabrication of ultrafine MnO
   nanocrystals encapsulated in a porous carbon matrix, where nanopores
   increase active sites to store redox ions and enhance ionic diffusivity
   to encapsulated MnO nanocrystals. As an anode material for lithium-ion
   batteries (LIBs), these MnO@C composites exhibited a high reversible
   specific capacity of 1221 mA h g(-1) after 100 cycles at a current
   density of 100 mA g(-1). The excellent electrochemical performance can
   be attributed to their unique structure with MnO nanocrystals dispersed
   uniformly inside a porous carbon matrix, which can largely enhance the
   electrical conductivity and effectively avoid the aggregation of MnO
   nanocrystals, and relieve the strain caused by the volumetric change
   during the charge/discharge process. This facile and economical strategy
   will extend the scope of metal-organic framework-derived synthesis for
   other materials in energy storage applications.},

   solid-lubricating materials. And then the review highlights progress in
   the design and exploration of high temperature solid-lubricating
   coatings (monolithic coatings, multiphase coatings and self-adaptive
   coatings) and composites (metal, intermetallic and ceramic matrices high
   temperature solid-lubricating composites). Finally, we shortly introduce
   practical applications and trends of high temperature solid-lubricating
   materials in the future. These developments offer new avenues to both
   intensify the understanding of high temperature tribology and expand the

Title = {An analytical model for elastic modulus calculation of SiC
   whisker-reinforced hybrid metal matrix nanocomposite containing SiC
   nanoparticles},

Abstract = {In the present work, elastic modulus of a hybrid aluminum matrix
   nanocomposite (HAMNC) reinforced with silicon carbide (SiC) whiskers and
   SiC nanoparticles is analyzed. To this end, a new multi-scale analytical
   model is developed to calculate the effective elastic modulus of the
   HAMNC. The SiC nano-particle aggregation into the HAMNC, frequently
   encountered in real engineering situations, is simulated. The elastic
   modulus of HAMNC estimated by the analytical micromechanical model is
   compared with that directly measured by the experimental method and a
   good agreement is found between the two sets of results. The effects of
   volume fraction, aspect ratio and dispersion type of SiC whiskers as
   well as volume fraction, size and aggregation degree of SiC
   nanoparticles on the HAMNC elastic modulus are extensively investigated.
   It is found that the elastic modulus of the SiC whisker-reinforced
   composite is significantly improved due to the addition of SiC
   nanoparticles. The results show that the nanoparticle aggregation has a
   damaging effect on the HAMNC elastic modulus. It is observed that the
   HAMNC elastic modulus can be enhanced by (i) increasing SiC content,
   (ii) aligning the SiC whiskers, (iii) increasing the SiC whisker aspect
   ratio (iv) decreasing the SiC nanoparticle size and (v) uniform
   dispersion of SiC nanoparticles into the hybrid nanocomposite. The
   reported results by means of the analytical model can be actually useful
   to guide design of general hybrid metal matrix nanocomposites with
   superior effective properties. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   porous solids. Conversely, polymers are flexible, malleable, and
   processable solids that are used for a broad range of commonly used
   technologies. The stark differences between the nature of MOFs and
   polymers has motivated efforts to hybridize crystalline MOFs and
   flexible polymers to produce composites that retain the desired
   properties of these disparate materials. Importantly, studies have shown
   that MOFs can be used to influence polymer structure, and polymers can
   be used to modulate MOF growth and characteristics. In this Review, we
   highlight the development and recent advances in the synthesis of
   MOF-polymer mixed-matrix membranes (MMMs) and applications of these MMMs
   in gas and liquid separations and purifications, including aqueous
   applications such as dye removal, toxic heavy metal sequestration, and
   desalination. Other elegant ways of synthesizing MOF-polymer hybrid
   materials, such as grafting polymers to and from MOFs, polymerization of
   polymers within MOFs, using polymers to template MOFs, and the bottom-up
   synthesis of polyMOFs and polyMOPs are also discussed. This review

Abstract = {Ni-based metal organic frameworks (Ni-MOFs) with unique hierarchical
   hollow ball-in-ball nanostructure were synthesized by solvothermal
   reactions. After successive carbonization and oxidation treatments,
   hierarchical NiO/Ni nanocrystals covered with a graphene shell were
   obtained with the hollow ball-in-ball nanostructure intact. The
   resulting materials exhibited superior performance as the anode in
   lithium ion batteries (LIBs): they provide high reversible specific
   capacity (1144 mAh/g), excellent cyclability (nearly no capacity loss
   after 1000 cycles) and rate performance (805 mAh/g at 15 A/g). In
   addition, the hierarchical NiO/Ni/Graphene composites demonstrated
   promising performance as anode materials for sodium-ion batteries
   (SIBs). Such a superior lithium and sodium storage performance is
   derived from the well-designed hierarchical hollow ball-in-ball
   structure of NiO/Ni/Graphene composites, which not only mitigates the
   volume expansion of NiO during the cycles but also provides a continuous
   highly conductive graphene matrix to facilitate the fast charge transfer
   and form a stable SEI layer.},

Abstract = {Pyrolysis of a bimetallic metal-organic framework
   (MIL-88-Fe/Ni)-dicyandiamide composite yield a Fe and Ni containing
   carbonaceous material, which is an efficient bifunctional
   electrocatalyst for overall water splitting. FeNi3 and NiFe2O4 are found
   as metallic and metal oxide compounds closely embedded in an N-doped
   carbon-carbon nanotube matrix. This hybrid catalyst (Fe-Ni@NC-CNTs)
   significantly promotes the charge transfer efficiency and restrains the
   corrosion of the metallic catalysts, which is shown in a high OER and
   HER activity with an overpotential of 274 and 202mV, respectively at
   10mAcm(-2) in alkaline solution. When this bifunctional catalyst was
   further used for H-2 and O-2 production in an electrochemical
   water-splitting unit, it can operate in ambient conditions with a
   competitive gas production rate of 1.15 and 0.57Ls(-1) for hydrogen and
   oxygen, respectively, showing its potential for practical applications.},

   especially for people living in arid regions. Sorption-based atmospheric
   water harvesting (AWH) is an appealing way to solve this problem.
   However, the state-of-the-art AWH technologies have poor water
   harvesting performance in arid climates owing to the low water sorption
   capacity of common sorbents under low humidity conditions. We report a
   high-performance composite sorbent for efficient water harvesting from
   arid air by confining hygroscopic salt in a metal-organic framework
   matrix (LiCl@MIL-101(Cr)). The composite sorbent shows 0.77 g g(-1)
   water sorption capacity at 1.2 kPa vapor pressure (30 \% relative
   humidity at 30 degrees C) by integrating the multi-step sorption
   processes of salt chemisorption, deliquescence, and solution absorption.
   A highly efficient AWH prototype is demonstrated with LiCl@MIL-101(Cr)
   that can enable the harvesting of 0.45-0.7 kg water per kilogram of
   material under laboratory and outdoor ambient conditions powered by
   natural sunlight without optical concentration and additional energy

   and metal-organic framework glasses. The glass acts as a matrix for
   LHPs, effectively stabilizing nonequilibrium perovskite phases through
   interfacial interactions. These interactions also passivate LHP surface
   defects and impart bright, narrow-band photoluminescence with a wide
   gamut for creating white light-emitting diodes (LEDs). The processable
   composites show high stability against immersion in water and organic
   solvents as well as exposure to heat, light, air, and ambient humidity.
   These properties, together with their lead self-sequestration
   capability, can enable breakthrough applications for LHPs.},

   that addition of an optimized mixture of graphene and multilayer
   graphene to the composites with different matrix materials produces the
   record-high enhancement of the effective thermal conductivity at the
   small filler loading fraction (f <= 10 vol\%). The thermal conductivity
   enhancement due to the presence of graphene in the composites has been
   observed for a range of matrix materials used by industry. The hybrid
   composites where graphene is utilized together with metallic micro- and
   nanoparticles allow one to tune both the thermal and electrical
   conductivity of these materials. Theoretical considerations indicate
   that the graphene-based thermal interface materials can outperform those
   with carbon nanotubes, metal nanoparticles and other fillers owing to
   graphene's geometry, mechanical flexibility and lower Kapitza resistance
   at the graphene-base material interface. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {Thermally conductive polymer composites (TCPCs) are highly desirable for
   thermal management in modern electrical systems and next-generation
   flexible electronic devices. However, the integration of superior
   thermal conductivity, good mechanical performance, and high
   thermostability in TCPCs remains a daunting challenge, due to the
   utilization of abundant rigid fillers (such as graphene, boron nitride
   and aluminum nitride) and the low thermal stability of polymer matrices.
   Herein, a highly thermally conductive film with excellent mechanical
   strength and toughness is developed based on soft liquid metal (LM) and
   rigid aramid nanofibers (ANFs), via a vacuum infiltration technique. The
   LM/ANF composite films possess superior in-plane and through-plane
   thermal conductivity (7.14 @ 1.68 W m(-1) K-1) because of the formation
   of a tightly packed structure, in which LM droplets are randomly
   distributed among the well-ordered ANFs to construct efficient heat
   conduction networks. Meanwhile, an outstanding tensile strength of 108.5
   MPa and a high toughness of 10.3 MJ m(-3) are achieved in the LM/ANF
   composite films. Furthermore, the LM/ANF composite films also have
   remarkable thermostability, flexibility, and mechanical reliability,
   without an obvious change in the thermal conductivity even at an
   elevated temperature of 250 degrees C and after repeated folding for
   1000 cycles, respectively. These admirable features shed light on the
   application of the LM/ANF composite films for thermal management of
   high-power integrated electronic devices.},

   implications for implementation of membrane technologies in large-scale
   carbon capture projects. High-permeability polymers rarely generate
   sufficient selectivity for energy-efficient CO2 capture. Here we report
   substantial selectivity enhancements within high-permeability polymers
   as a result of the efficient dispersion of amine-functionalized,
   nanosized metal-organic framework (MOF) additives. The enhancement
   effects under optimal mixing conditions occur with minimal loss in
   overall permeability. Nanosizing of the MOF enhances its dispersion
   within the polymer matrix to minimize non-selective microvoid formation
   around the particles. Amination of such MOFs increases their interaction
   with the polymer matrix, resulting in a measured rigidification and
   enhanced selectivity of the overall composite. The optimal MOF MMM
   performance was verified in three different polymer systems, and also
   over pressure and temperature ranges suitable for carbon capture.},

Abstract = {The widespread use of communication equipment has exacerbated the
   deterioration of the electromagnetic environment, urgently requiring the
   development of more efficient electromagnetic wave (EMW) absorption
   materials. Two-dimensional metal carbides are highly regarded for their
   characteristic structure and excellent electrical conductivity. Here, to
   break the single way of designing Ti3C2Tx MXene composites and to
   compensate for their lack of magnetic loss capability, an attempt was
   made to prepare composites with magnetic NiCo/Carbon nanotubes (CNTs)
   modification to achieve EMW absorption. Such CNTs-encapsulated Ni and Co
   metal particles anchored in the matrix, coupled with a multilayer
   laminate structure, enable the composite to have enhanced EMW
   absorption. Remarkably, the NiCo/TiC/TiO/CNTs composites exhibit
   excellent EMW absorption performance at a filling level of only 14.2
   wt\%. The minimum reflection loss (RL) of-51.98 dB and the maximum
   effective absorption bandwidth of 7.76 GHz were obtained at thicknesses
   of 1.9 mm and 2.1 mm, respectively. In addition to this, the possible
   mechanisms involved in EMW absorption have been elucidated in detail.
   These results demonstrate an environmentally friendly and simple
   strategy for the preparation of EMW absorbers based on Ti3C2Tx MXene
   substrate.},

  abstract                   = {Pharmaceuticals, heavy metals, pesticides, and dyes are the main
   environmental contaminants that have serious effects on both land and
   aquatic lives and necessitate the development of effective methods to
   mitigate these issues. Although some conventional methods are in use to
   tackle soil contamination, but biochar and biocharbased composites
   represent a reliable and sustainable means to deal with a spectrum of
   toxic organic and inorganic pollutants from contaminated environments.
   The capacity of biochars and derived constructs to remediate inorganic
   dyes, pesticides, insecticides, heavy metals, and pharmaceuticals from
   environmental matrices is attributed to their extensive surface area,
   surface functional groups, pore size distribution, and high sorption
   capability of these pollutants in water and soil environments.
   Application conditions, biochar feedstock, pyrolysis conditions and
   precursor materials are the factors that influence the capacity and
   functionality of biochar to adsorb pollutants from wastewater and soil.
   These factors, when improved, can benefit biochar in agrochemical and
   heavy metal remediation from various environments. However, the
   processes involved in biochar production and their influence in
   enhancing pollutant sequestration remain unclear. Therefore, this paper
   throws light on the current strategies, operational conditions, and
   sequestration performance of biochar and biochar-based composites for
   agrochemical and heavy metal in soil and water environments. The main
   challenges associated with biochar preparation and exploitation,
   toxicity evaluation, research directions and future prospects for
   biochar in environmental remediation are also outlined.},

   polymers are very attractive for the manufacturing of gas separation
   membranes. But only few of these materials could be manufactured into
   high-performance asymmetric or composite membranes. We report here the
   first mixed matrix composite membrane made of commercially available
   poly (amide-b-ethylene oxide) (Pebax (R) 1657, Arkema) mixed with the
   nano-sized zeolitic imidazole framework ZIF-7. This hybrid material has
   been successfully deposited as a thin layer (less than 1 mu m) on a
   porous polyacrylonitrile (PAN) support. An intermediate gutter layer of
   PTMSP was applied to serve as a flat and smooth surface for coating to
   avoid polymer penetration into the porous support. Key features of this
   work are the preparation and use of ultra-small ZIF-7 nano-particles
   (around 30-35 nm) and the membrane processability of Pebax (R) 1657. SEM
   pictures show that excellent adhesion and almost ideal morphology
   between the two phases has been obtained simply by mixing the
   as-synthesized ZIF-7 suspension into the Pebax (R) 1657 dope, and no
   voids or clusters can be observed. The performance of the composite
   membrane is characterized by single gas permeation measurement of CO2,
   N-2 and CH4. Both, permeability (P-CO2 up to 145 barrer) and gas
   selectivity (CO2/N-2 up to 97 and CO2/CH4 up to 30) can be increased at
   low ZIF- loading. The CO2/CH4 selectivity can be further increased to 44
   with the filler loading of 34 wt\%, but the permeability is reduced
   compared to the pure Pebax (R) 1657 membrane. Polymer chain
   rigidification at high filler loading is supposed to be a reason for the
   reduced permeability. The composite membranes prepared in this work show
   better performance in terms of permeance and selectivity when compared
   with asymmetric mixed matrix membranes described in the recent
   literature. Overall, the ZIF 7/Pebax mixed matrix membranes show a high
   performance for CO2 separation from methane and other gas streams. They
   are easy to fabricate, which makes them attractive for industrial scale
   gas separation. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract                   = {In the field of hybrid natural fiber polymer composites, there has been
   a recent surge in research and innovation for structural applications.
   To expand the strengths and applications of this category of materials,
   significant effort was put into improving their mechanical properties.
   Hybridization is a designed technique for fiber-reinforced composite
   materials that involves combining two or more fibers of different groups
   within a single matrix to manipulate the desired properties. They may be
   made from a mix of natural and synthetic fibers, synthetic and synthetic
   fibers, or natural fiber and carbonaceous materials. Owing to their
   diverse properties, hybrid natural fiber composite materials are
   manufactured from a variety of materials, including rubber, elastomer,
   metal, ceramics, glasses, and plants, which come in composite, sandwich
   laminate, lattice, and segmented shapes. Hybrid composites have a wide
   range of uses, including in aerospace interiors, naval, civil building,
   industrial, and sporting goods. This study intends to provide a summary
   of the factors that contribute to natural fiber-reinforced polymer
   composites' mechanical and structural failure as well as overview the
   details and developments that have been achieved with the composites.},

Abstract = {2-Mercaptobenzimidazole (M) was successfully inbuilt in zeolitic
   imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8) on GO nanosheets and then imbedded into
   epoxy coating to prepare composite coating with pH-responsive and self
   healing performances. Results showed that M-ZIF-8/GO possessed
   remarkable pH-triggered activity. The excellent self-healing behavior of
   M-ZIF-8/GO/EP coating was demonstrated by local electrochemical
   impedance spectroscopy, which was attributed to the release of corrosion
   inhibitors that could form a compact protective film on the metal. The
   anti-corrosion performance of matrix coating was also enhanced
   effectively because MZIF-8/GO could react with epoxy resin which greatly
   increased the compatibility of M-ZIF-8/GO and the crosslinking density
   of epoxy coating.},

   surface area similar to 1300-1600 m(2) g(-1)) were directly incorporated
   into a model polymer matrix (Matrimid (R) 5218) by solution mixing. This
   produces flexible transparent membranes with excellent dispersion of
   nanoparticles (up to loadings of 30 wt\%) with good adhesion within the
   polymer matrix, as confirmed by scanning electron microscopy, dynamic
   mechanical thermal analysis and gas sorption studies. Pure gas (H-2,
   CO2, O-2, N-2 and CH4) permeation tests showed enhanced permeability of
   the mixed matrix membrane with negligible losses in selectivity.
   Positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy (PALS) indicated that an
   increase in the free volume of the polymer with ZIF-8 loading together
   with the free diffusion of gas through the cages of ZIF-8 contributed to
   an increase in gas permeability of the composite membrane. The gas
   transport properties of the composite membranes were well predicted by a
   Maxwell model whilst the processing strategy reported can be extended to
   fabricate other polymer nanocomposite membranes intended for a wide
   range of emerging energy applications.},

  abstract                   = {Cold gas dynamic spray or simply cold spray (CS) is a process in which
   solid powders are accelerated in a de Laval nozzle toward a substrate.
   If the impact velocity exceeds a threshold value, particles endure
   plastic deformation and adhere to the surface. Different materials such
   as metals, ceramics, composites and polymers can be deposited using CS,
   creating a wealth of interesting opportunities towards harvesting
   particular properties. CS is a novel and promising technology to obtain
   surface coating, offering several technological advantages over thermal
   spray since it utilizes kinetic rather than thermal energy for
   deposition. As a result, tensile residual stresses, oxidation and
   undesired chemical reactions can be avoided. Development of new material
   systems with enhanced properties covering a wide range of required
   functionalities of surfaces and interfaces, from internal combustion
   engines to biotechnology, brought forth new opportunities to the cold
   spraying with a rich variety of material combinations. As applications
   multiply, the total number of studies on this subject is expanding
   rapidly and it is worth summarizing the current state of knowledge. This
   review covers different material systems that have been studied up to
   now with an emphasis on potential innovative applications. This includes
   metallic, ceramic and metal matrix composite (MMC) coatings and their
   applications. Polymer (both as substrate and coating) and metal
   embedment in the polymer are also covered. CS has emerged as a promising
   process to deposit nanostructured materials without significantly
   altering their microstructure whereas many traditional consolidation
   processes do. Relevant material systems containing nanostructured
   powders are also considered. A critical discussion on the future of this
   technology is provided at the final part of the paper focusing on the
   microstructural bonding mechanisms for those relatively less explored
   material systems. These include MMCs involving more than one
   constituent, ceramics, polymers and nanostructured powders. Future
   investigations are suggested especially to quantitatively link the
   process parameters and the behaviour of the material systems of interest
   during impact.},

   energy density limits. Use of lithium metal anode can enable high-energy
   batteries. However, the safety hazards and lithium dendrite formation
   associated with lithium metal require safe electrolytes to replace
   flammable liquid ones. In recent years, solid-state electrolytes have
   attracted tremendous attention. Among them, composite polymer
   electrolytes (CPEs) with different constitutions have the unique
   advantages of low interfacial resistance, high ionic conductivity, and
   flexible characteristics. Here, the basic properties and analysis
   methods related to CPEs are discussed. Following that, the components
   added into the polymer matrix, such as organic solvents, nanostructured
   ceramics, and fast-ion-conductive inorganics are classified. CPEs used
   in low-cost Na and K batteries are briefly discussed. It is hoped that
   the review can supply both advances and fundamentals to the researchers
   in this field and provide guidance for the development of CPEs for
   lithium battery systems, and beyond.},

   storage systems because of its high specific capacity of 1675 mAh g(-1)
   based on sulfur. However, the rapid capacity degradation, mainly caused
   by polysulfide dissolution, remains a significant challenge prior to
   practical applications. This work demonstrates that a novel Ni-based
   metal organic framework (Ni-MOF), Ni-6(BTB)(4)(BP)(3) (BTB =
   benzene-1,3,5-tribenzoate and BP = 4,4'-bipyridyl), can remarkably
   immobilize polysulfides within the cathode structure through physical
   and chemical interactions at molecular level. The capacity retention
   achieves up to 89\% after 100 cycles at 0.1 C. The excellent performance
   is attributed to the synergistic effects of the interwoven mesopores
   (similar to 2.8 nm) and micropores (similar to 4.4 nm) of Ni-MOF, which
   first provide an ideal matrix to confine polysulfides, and the strong
   interactions between Lewis acidic Ni(II) center and the polysulfide
   base, which significantly slow down the migration of soluble
   polysulfides out of the pores, leading to the excellent cycling
   performance of Ni-MOF/S composite.},

Abstract = {Titania (TiO2) nanoparticles were added to polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)
   matrix to form nanocomposite coating via spin coating method on the AA
   2024 (one of the aluminum alloys) to improve the anticorrosion ability
   of metal. The microstructures of the PDMS/TiO2 composite coating were
   detected by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Fourier transform
   infrared (FTIR) spectrometry to verify the structure of composite
   coating. The corrosion properties of PDMS/TiO2 composite coating was
   evaluated by the electrochemical tests. The results showed that the
   anticorrosion ability of the composite coating has been significantly
   affected by the TiO2 content. For example, the impedance modulus value
   reached 106 Omega cm(2) of the composite coating with 8 wt \% nano-TiO2
   fillers. Meanwhile, the corrosion current density (I-corr) of the
   coating was smaller than that of bare aluminum. The long term immersion
   experiments of coating were performed and the results demonstrated that
   the coating still had a protective effect on aluminum after 40 days of
   immersion. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Recent progress of fillers in mixed matrix membranes for CO2 separation:
   A review},

Year = {2017},
Volume = {188},

Abstract = {Among various CO2-mitigation technologies, membrane-based technology has
   offered a more energy efficient and eco-friendly process for CO2
   separation from large emission sources, in order to reduce CO2 emission
   level into atmosphere. In general, polymeric and inorganic membranes
   have been used in gas separation processes, but each has its own pros
   and cons. Currently, membrane research has addressed the trade-off
   limitations of membranes in different ways through fabrication of new
   type of mixed matrix membranes (MMMs) by incorporation of inorganic
   particles as fillers into polymer matrices. The performance of MMMs
   depends on textural properties of fillers, molecular sieving effect and
   membrane-penetrant interactions. The main challenges in the fabrication
   of MMMs is selection of fillers, which controls the gas separation
   characteristics of membranes. In this review, the influences of fillers
   like zeolite, carbon, and metal organic framework in MMMs fabrication
   and their CO2 permeability and CO2/CH4 and CO2/N-2 selectivity were
   compiled from recent reports. Further, a new protocol is introduced for
   screening of fillers, which will helps to development of new fillers as
   well as for fabrication of new MMMs with high CO2 separation capacity.

   fabrication of CoSe2 nanoparticles embedded within N-doped porous
   graphitic carbon nanocubes/carbon nanotubes (CoSe2@N-PGC/CNTs). The
   composites are prepared by decomposition under the reducing atmosphere
   and further selenization of Co-based zeolitic imidazolate framework
   (ZIF-67) precursor. The metallic Co nanoparticles formed during the
   reduction process play a key role in catalyzing the in-situ formation of
   graphitic carbon and extrusion of CNTs from the surface of the composite
   nanocube using carbon sources originated from organic ligands in ZIF-67
   templates. The direct selenization process of ZIF-67 produces the
   composite nanocubes (CoSe2@AC) of CoSe2 and amorphous carbon. The
   specific discharge capacities of the CoSe2@NPGC/CNTs and CoSe2@AC
   composite nanocubes after 100 cycles at a current density of 0.2 A g(-1)
   were 424 and 100 mA h g(-1), respectively. The excellent electrochemical
   performance of CoSe2@N-PGC/CNTs composite nanocubes are attributed to
   their unique compositional and structural features. Especially, the
   carbon matrix with CNTs could not only effectively inhibit volume
   expansion during cycling but also maintain the integrity of the
   structure. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Impact of graphene oxide on removal of heavy metals using mixed matrix
   membrane},
Journal = {CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {292},
Pages = {284-297},
Month = {MAY 15},
Abstract = {The graphene oxide (GO) impregnated mixed matrix membrane (MMM) was
   prepared by non-solvent induced phase inversion method. MMM was
   characterized in terms of molecular weight cut-off, porosity,
   permeability, average pore size, pore size distribution, contact angle,
   zeta potential and mechanical strength. The membrane became highly
   permeable, hydrophilic and charged on addition of GO. The surface
   morphology and roughness were studied through scanning electron and
   atomic force microscopy. Efficacy of MMM for removal of heavy metals was
   explored using the developed MMM. It showed high adsorption capacity for
   Pb2+ (79 mg/g), Cu2+ (75 mg/g), Cd2+ (68 mg/g) and Cr6+ (154 mg/g) at
   natural pH, 6.7, 6.5, 6.4 and 3.5, respectively. The steady state
   permeate flux was around 301/m(2) h for 50 mg/l feed concentration at
   414 kPa transmembrane pressure drop and 401/h cross flow rate. Rejection
   of Pb, Cu, Cd and Cr were in between 90\% and 96\% for various operating
   conditions and the breakthrough time was around 10 h for different metal
   ions. The membrane was regenerated in-situ, by acidic solution at pH
   5.5. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {A dual-metal-organic-framework derived electrocatalyst for oxygen
   reduction},
Journal = {ENERGY \& ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {9},
Number = {10},
Pages = {3092-3096},
Abstract = {High-performance electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction are
   indispensable in many electrochemical energy storage and conversion
   technologies. However, the lack of efficient and inexpensive catalysts
   or catalyst systems that can compete with noble metal catalysts hinders
   their large-scale industrial applications. As an important class of
   porous materials, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with systematically
   tailored structures and compositions have recently been suggested as
   promising precursors for the preparation of diverse functional
   materials. Here we report a dual-MOF confined-pyrolysis approach for the
   preparation of iron carbide nanoparticle-embedded carbon nanotube
   assemblies. Starting from a novel MOF-in-MOF precursor consisting of a
   Zn-based MOF polyhedron host and many engulfed Fe-based MOF nanorods, a
   complex structured composite material constructed from iron carbide
   nanocrystallite-embedded carbon nanotubes encapsulated in a porous
   carbon matrix is successfully prepared. We further demonstrate that the
   as-derived composite material manifests remarkable electrocatalytic
   performance for the oxygen reduction reaction in an alkaline
   electrolyte. The present strategy significantly expands the toolbox for
   the design and synthesis of MOF-derived functional materials for a wide
   range of applications.},

Title = {A High-Efficiency Sulfur/Carbon Composite Based on 3D Graphene
   Nanosheet@Carbon Nanotube Matrix as Cathode for Lithium-Sulfur Battery},
Journal = {ADVANCED ENERGY MATERIALS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {7},
Number = {11},
Month = {JUN 7},
Abstract = {Carbon materials have attracted extensive attention as the host
   materials of sulfur for lithium-sulfur battery, especially those with 3D
   architectural structure. Here, a novel 3D graphene nanosheet-carbon
   nanotube (GN-CNT) matrix is obtained through a simple one-pot pyrolysis
   process. The length and density of CNTs can be readily tuned by altering
   the additive amount of carbon source (urea). Specifically, CNTs are in
   situ introduced onto the surface of the graphene nanosheets (GN) and
   show a stable covalent interaction with GN. Besides, in the GN-CNT
   matrix, cobalt nanoparticles with different diameters exist as being
   wrapped in the top of CNTs or scattering on the GN surface, and abundant
   heteroatoms (N, O) are detected, both of which can help in immobilizing
   sulfur species. Such a rationally designed 3D GN-CNT matrix makes much
   more sense in enhancing the electrochemical performance of the sulfur
   cathode for rapid charge transfer and favorable electrolyte
   infiltration. Moreover, the presence of dispersed cobalt nanoparticles
   is beneficial for trapping lithium polysulfides by strong chemical
   interaction, and facilitating the mutual transformation between the
   high-order polysulfides and low-order ones. As a result, the S/GN-CNT
   composite presents a high sulfur utilization and large capacity on the
   basis of the S/GN-CNT composite as active material.},

Title = {Optimization of cutting parameters for minimizing power consumption and

   composites},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},

Abstract = {Reducing the energy consumption during machining of metal matrix
   composites (MMC) can significantly improve the environmental performance
   of manufacturing systems. To achieve this, calculation of energy
   consumption in the computerized numerical controlled (CNC) turning
   machine is required. It is important to minimize the power consumption
   and maximize tool life during machining operations, being performed on
   the CNC turning machine. However, this is challenging due to complexity
   of manufacturing systems and the nature of material being machined. This
   paper presents the findings of experimental investigations into the
   effects of cutting speed, feed rate, depth of cut and nose radius in CNC
   turning of 7075 Al alloy 15 wt\% SiC (particle size 20-40 mu m)
   composite. Design of experiment techniques, i.e. response surface
   methodology (RSM) has been used to accomplish the objective of the
   experimental study. The machining parameters such as cutting speed, feed
   rate, depth of cut and nose radius are optimized by multi-response
   considerations namely power consumption and tool life. A composite
   desirability value is obtained for the multi-responses using individual
   desirability values from the desirability function analysis. Based on
   composite desirability value, the optimum levels of parameters have been
   identified, and significant contribution of parameters is determined by
   analysis of variance. Confirmation test is also conducted to validate
   the test result. It is clearly shown that the multi-responses in the
   machining process are improved through this approach. Thus, the
   application of desirability function analysis in response surface
   methodology proves to be an effective tool for optimizing the machining
   parameters of 7075 Al alloy 15 wt\% SiC (20-40 gm) composite. Result of
   this research work show that when turning is be carried out at values of
   machining parameters obtained by multi response optimization through
   desirability analysis route this will reduce power consumption by
   13.55\% and increase tool life by 22.12\%. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {Synthesis of Ti3C2/Fe3O4/PANI hierarchical architecture composite as an

Abstract = {A hierarchical architecture of Ti3C2/Fe3O4/PANI composite as a
   high-efficiency microwave absorber was synthesized using HF etching,
   coprecipitation and in-situ polymerization route. Layered Ti3C2 was used
   as a matrix material with high surface area and a network offering more
   paths of electron transfer. The adding of PANI and Fe3O4 can generate an
   outstanding microwave absorption property because of enhanced
   interfacial polarization, strong attenuation loss and excellent
   impedance matching. The hierarchical Ti3C2/Fe3O4/PANI ternary composite
   shows a strongest reflection loss (R-L) of -40.3 dB at 15.3 GHz, which
   is higher than those of Fe3O4 and Ti3C2/Fe3O4. Furthermore, it also
   displays broad absorption frequency band, possessing the efficient
   absorption bandwidth (< -10 dB) of 5.2 GHz (from 12.8 to 18 GHz) at only
   1.9 mm. The improving microwave absorption performances may be ascribed
   to hierarchical structure and synergistic effect of combining Ti3C2,
   Fe3O4 and PANI. The results of this work provide a new idea of utilizing
   Ti3C2 matrix to prepare 3D hierarchical composite for the applications
   of MXene family in microwave absorption fields.},

  abstract                   = {Composites have been found to be the most promising and discerning
   material available in this century. Presently, composites reinforced
   with fibers of synthetic or natural materials are gaining more
   importance as demands for lightweight materials with high strength for
   specific applications are growing in the market. Fiber-reinforced
   polymer composite offers not only high strength to weight ratio, but
   also reveals exceptional properties such as high durability; stiffness;
   damping property; flexural strength; and resistance to corrosion, wear,
   impact, and fire. These wide ranges of diverse features have led
   composite materials to find applications in mechanical, construction,
   aerospace, automobile, biomedical, marine, and many other manufacturing
   industries. Performance of composite materials predominantly depends on
   their constituent elements and manufacturing techniques, therefore,
   functional properties of various fibers available worldwide, their
   classifications, and the manufacturing techniques used to fabricate the
   composite materials need to be studied in order to figure out the
   optimized characteristic of the material for the desired application. An
   overview of a diverse range of fibers, their properties, functionality,
   classification, and various fiber composite manufacturing techniques is
   presented to discover the optimized fiber-reinforced composite material
   for significant applications. Their exceptional performance in the
   numerous fields of applications have made fiber-reinforced composite
   materials a promising alternative over solitary metals or alloys.},

   exhibit charming physical and chemical properties. The superiority in 2D
   flak structure, combined with rich functional groups, endows MXenes

   in various fields. Furthermore, the special structural and functional
   features also make MXenes and MXene-based materials easy to combine with
   polymer matrices to meet its high-performance requirements in
   electrical, thermal, mechanical and other fields. Now, a variety of
   synthetic methods of MXenes have been explored to suit different
   application, from hydrofluoric acid to fluorinate-containing acid
   solution and fluorinate-containing salts. Moreover, diverse modification
   methods were studied based on abundant terminations of MXene, which are
   also reviewed. In addition, the fabrication method and performances of
   MXene/polymer composites are also invested to explore the influence of
   MXenes on the properties of composite materials. Subsequently, the
   applications of MXene-based polymeric composites with different
   properties were also reviewed to explore their application prospects.
   Lastly, based on current development situation of MXenes, the challenges
   and prospects for the development of MXene/polymer composites are
   discussed. In view of the splendid performance of MXenes, obviously, it
   is certain that MXenes would play a vital role in polymer composites and

Abstract = {Mechanical alloying (MA) is a solid-state powder processing technique
   that was developed in the 1960s to synthesize nickel-based
   oxide-dispersion strengthened (ODS) superalloys that combine the twin
   effects of precipitation hardening (for intermediate temperature
   strength) and dispersion hardening (for elevated temperature strength).
   These ODS alloys contain very fine, nanometer-sized, oxide (and other
   ceramic) phase particles to impart the high-temperature strength and can
   be considered the first nanocomposites synthesized by MA. In comparison
   to other techniques such as solidification processing or internal
   oxidation, MA is a simple technique with unique advantages. For example,
   it is very easy to obtain nanostructures in most cases, a high volume
   fraction of the reinforcement phase can be introduced into the
   composite, and consolidation of the milled powder to full density is
   relatively easy. Recent advances in the synthesis and properties of
   nanocomposites obtained by MA have been reviewed here. Both metal-based
   and ceramic-based nanocomposites have been discussed. Extensive list of
   references, majority of them published after the year 2000, have been
   provided. The review also contains complete listing of all the data that
   is available for each category of the composites. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {Metal-organic frameworks as novel matrices for efficient enzyme
   immobilization: An update review},
Journal = {COORDINATION CHEMISTRY REVIEWS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {406},
Month = {MAR 1},
Abstract = {As a typical green methodology, enzymatic catalysis has been extensively
   employed in multitudinous chemical and biological transformation
   procedures. However, intrinsic fragile nature of enzymes makes them
   prone to denaturation or destabilization in harsh practical conditions,
   leading to unavoidably shortened lifespan and extremely high cost. It
   was proven that enzyme immobilization is an efficient strategy for
   enhancing their catalytic performance in continuous industrial
   practices. Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs) with extremely high specific
   surface area, abundant porosity, extraordinary multifunctionality, and
   relatively high stability, in recent years, have attracted remarkable
   research interests as novel supporting matrices for efficient enzyme
   immobilization and protection. Many reported MOFs-enzyme composites
   exhibit unprecedented catalytic performances than those of free enzymes,
   including improved enzyme efficiency, stability, selectivity, and
   recyclability, due to the protection of enzymes by highly ordered
   frameworks. To present a systematic overview of this emerging and
   developing field, herein, we summarize an update review about the most
   recent advances in MOFs immobilizing enzymes from the aspects of general
   synthetic approaches, critical impact factors, enhanced catalytic
   performances, and the practical applications. Subsequently, the emerging
   theories, methodologies and technologies in this thriving area are
   briefly introduced. Finally, barriers and future perspectives about MOFs
   for enzyme immobilization are also discussed. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {A new solid polymer electrolyte incorporating Li10GeP2S12 into a
   polyethylene oxide matrix for all-solid-state lithium batteries},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {301},
Pages = {47-53},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {Li10GeP2S12 (LGPS) is incorporated into polyethylene oxide (PEO) matrix
   to fabricate composite solid polymer electrolyte (SPE) membranes. The
   lithium ion conductivities of as-prepared composite membranes are
   evaluated, and the optimal composite membrane exhibits a maximum ionic
   conductivity of 1.21 x 10(-3) S cm(-1) at 80 degrees C and an
   electrochemical window of 0-5.7 V. The phase transition behaviors for
   electrolytes are characterized by DSC, and the possible reasons for
   their enhanced ionic conductivities are discussed. The LGPS
   microparticles, acting as active fillers incorporation into the PEO
   matrix, have a positive effect on the ionic conductivity, lithium ion
   transference number and electrochemical stabilities. In addition, two
   kinds of all-solid-state lithium batteries (LiFeO4/SPE/Li and
   LiCoO2/SPE/Li) are fabricated to demonstrate the good compatibility
   between this new SPE membrane and different electrodes. And the
   LiFePO4/Li battery exhibits fascinating electrochemical performance with
   high capacity retention (92.5\% after 50 cycles at 60 degrees C) and
   attractive capacities of 158, 148,138 and 99 mAh g(-1) at current rates
   of 0.1 C, 0.2 C, 0.5 C and 1 C at 60 degrees C, respectively. It is
   demonstrated that this new composite SPE should be a promising
   electrolyte applied in solid state batteries based on lithium metal
   electrode. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Although the formation of zeolites in geopolymers have been mentioned in
   many works, a particular interest in geopolymer-zeolite composites
   started to increase very recently. Such hybrid materials connect the
   advantageous properties of both constituents: geopolymer serves as a
   strong and durable support for zeolites, when zeolites provide high
   surface area, porosity and adsorption capacity. The composites can be
   therefore used as bulk-type adsorbents as well as membranes in
   separation and pervaporation processes. The possibility of the
   utilization of industrial wastes for their production is also a
   sustainability benefit. This review article highlights advances in the
   field of geopolymer-zeolite composites manufacturing and applications.
   The resistance of zeolites in geopolymer matrices, methods of their
   detection and effect of their presence on the properties of hybrid
   materials are discussed as well. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {Facile strategy to synthesize MXene@LDH nanohybrids for boosting the
   flame retardancy and smoke suppression properties of epoxy},
Journal = {COMPOSITES PART A-APPLIED SCIENCE AND MANUFACTURING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {157},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The creation of high-efficient MXene-based flame retardants to cope with
   the fire hazards of polymer composites remained an intractable
   challenge. Hence, this work explored a facile strategy to synthesize
   MXene-based nanohybrids (MXene@LDH) by in situ growth of layered double
   hydroxides (CoAl-LDH) on the surface of MXene in anticipation of
   constructing an efficient flame retardant system. The results indicated
   that the integration of LDH prevented the stacking of MXene nanosheets
   and enhanced the dispersion of MXene in EP matrix, endowing EP
   composites with excellent thermal properties and flame retardancy. With
   the addition of 2 wt\% MXene@LDH, EP composites exhibited reduced the
   maximum mass loss rate (R-max) of 28.5\%, increased residual char and
   led to 25.3\% reduction in PHRR and a drop of 24.4\% in THR, compared to
   those of neat EP. Furthermore, EP/2 wt\% MXene@LDH composites also
   demonstrated superior smoke suppression performance, mainly reflected by
   the 38.5\%, 37.8\%, 33.8\% and 31.2\% reduction in PSPR, TSP, PCO and
   PCO2, respectively, together with a 52.0\% decline in smoke factor (SF),
   compared to those of pure EP. The improved fire safety of EP composites
   was attributed to the catalytic charring and attenuation effect of the
   transition metal oxides, coupled with the barrier effect of the
   nanosheets and the cooling effect, gas-phase dilution effect of LDH.},

   magnetic nanoparticles embedded in porous carbon matrix have emerged as
   promising candidate for lightweight electromagnetic wave absorber.
   Nevertheless, investigation on the optimization of impedance matching in
   the microwave absorption properties is insufficient. In this work,
   impedance matching is optimized to achieve strongest absorption
   intensity and broaden the effective frequency bandwidth. In detail,
   electromagnetic parameters have been controlled through changing the
   carbonization temperature to fulfill optimized impedance matching. RL
   value of -51.8 dB and an effective frequency bandwidth (f(e)) of 3.48
   GHz with a thickness of 2.6 mm can be achieved by sample prepared at
   500(circle)C and RL value of -15.0 dB and a f(e) of 4.72 GHz with a thin
   thickness of 1.8 mm can be reached by sample synthesized at
   600(circle)C. Comparative studies of each sample directly display the
   effect of impedance matching on the RL performance and possible
   attenuation mechanisms are also discussed. This work may deepen the
   understanding of the impedance matching and pave the way for the
   synthesis of high performance lightweight microwave absorber. (C) 2016

Abstract = {Critical to the selection requirements for additive manufacturing (AM)
   is the need for appropriate materials. Materials requirements for AM
   include the ability to produce the feedstock in a form amenable to the
   specific AM process, suitable processing of the material by AM,
   capability to be acceptably post processed to enhance geometry and
   properties, and manifestation of necessary performance characteristics
   in service. As AM has matured, specific classes of material have become
   associated with specific AM processes and applications. This paper
   gathers this information for each of the seven categories of ISO/ASTM AM
   categories. Polymers, metals, ceramics and composites are considered.
   Microstructural features affecting AM part properties are listed.
   Service properties of AM parts are described, including physical,
   mechanical, optical and electrical properties. An additive

Journal = {NATURE COMMUNICATIONS},

Abstract = {Advances in next-generation soft electronic devices rely on the
   development of highly deformable, healable, and printable energy
   generators to power these electronics. Development of deformable or
   wearable energy generators that can simultaneously attain extreme
   stretchability with superior healability remains a daunting challenge.
   We address this issue by developing a highly conductive, extremely
   stretchable, and healable composite based on thermoplastic elastomer
   with liquid metal and silver flakes as the stretchable conductor for
   triboelectric nanogenerators. The elastomer is used both as the matrix
   for the conductor and as the triboelectric layer. The nanogenerator
   showed a stretchability of 2500\% and it recovered its energy-harvesting
   performance after extreme mechanical damage, due to the supramolecular
   hydrogen bonding of the thermoplastic elastomer. The composite of the
   thermoplastic elastomer, liquid metal particles, and silver flakes
   exhibited an initial conductivity of 6250 S cm(-1) and recovered 96.0\%
   of its conductivity after healing.},

Abstract = {Printable elastic conductors promise large-area stretchable
   sensor/actuator networks for healthcare, wearables and robotics.
   Elastomers with metal nanoparticles are one of the best approaches to
   achieve high performance, but large-area utilization is limited by
   diffculties in their processability. Here we report a printable elastic
   conductor containing Ag nanoparticles that are formed in situ, solely by
   mixing micrometre-sized Ag flakes, fluorine rubbers, and surfactant. Our
   printable elastic composites exhibit conductivity higher than 4,000 S
   cm(-1) (highest value: 6,168 S cm(-1)) at 0\% strain, and 935 S cm(-1)
   when stretched up to 400\%. Ag nanoparticle formation is influenced by
   the surfactant, heating processes, and elastomer molecular weight,
   resulting in a drastic improvement of conductivity. Fully printed sensor
   networks for stretchable robots are demonstrated, sensing pressure and
   temperature accurately, even when stretched over 250\%.},

Abstract = {The development of multilayer composite membranes for CO2 separation has
   gained increasing attention due to the desire for energy efficient
   technologies. Multilayer composite membranes have many advantages,
   including the possibility to optimize membrane materials independently
   by layers according to their different functions and to reduce the
   overall transport resistance by using ultrathin selective layers, and
   less limitations on the material mechanical properties and
   processability. A comprehensive review is required to capture details of
   the progresses that have already been achieved in developing multilayer
   composite membranes with improved CO2 separation performance in the past
   15-20 years. In this review, various composite membrane preparation
   methods were compared, advances in composite membranes for CO2/CH4
   separation, CO2/N-2 and CO2/H-2 separation were summarized with detailed
   data, and challenges facing for the CO2 separation using composite
   membranes, such as aging, plasticization and long-term stability, were
   discussed. Finally the perspectives and future research directions for
   composite membranes were presented. (C) 2016, Institute of Process

Volume = {17},

Abstract = {Carbon nanofibre (CNF) is a potential reinforcement in Zn implants.
   Nevertheless, its poor interfacial compatibility reduces the
   reinforcement efficiency drastically. In this study, rare earth
   lanthanum (La) was used as a compatible interface layer between CNF and
   Zn matrix. On the one hand, La in situ grew on acidified CNF by a
   chemical synthesis and achieved a firm coordination covalent bond with
   the oxygenated functional group derived from CNF. On the other hand, La,
   as an active rare earth element, could carry out the alloying reaction
   with the Zn matrix, thus forming strong metal bonding. Results showed
   that the tensile strength of composites was enhanced from 180.2 +/- 12.1
   to 243.4 +/- 10.2 MPa since the La interface layer promoted the transfer
   of the interfacial shear stress from the Zn matrix to CNF and thereby
   consumed massive fracture energy. Encouragingly, it simultaneously
   improved the ductility, as La activated basal slip and improved the
   dislocation accommodation capacity. Moreover, the Zn implants displayed
   excellent anti-tumour efficiency.},

Title = {Rational design of two-dimensional nanofillers for polymer
   nanocomposites toward multifunctional applications},
Journal = {PROGRESS IN MATERIALS SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {115},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Nanocomposites consisting of two-dimensional (2D) nanostructured fillers
   embedded in a polymer matrix find ample opportunities to design
   multifunctional materials for new applications stemming from the
   nanofillers' exceptional properties. Despite similar geometries,
   different 2D materials such as graphene, hexagonal boron nitrides,
   MXene, and transition metal dichalcogenides exhibit vastly different
   electrical, thermal, optical and electromagnetic characteristics,
   providing an exciting pathway to creating composites with tailored
   multifunctional properties. The key is to rationally assemble 2D
   nanostructured fillers in the matrix with controlled multiscale
   structures so that their unique properties can be translated into the
   composites. This paper is dedicated to offering an overview of recent
   advances empowering the development of 2D nanofiller/polymer composites
   in the context of novel synthesis and assembly techniques, multiscale
   structural characteristics, multifunctional properties and emergent
   applications. Special emphasis is placed on identifying the critical
   relationships between the material parameters, processing conditions,
   structures created and properties of final products across nano-,
   micro-, and macroscales. The real-world understanding enables rational
   design of composites toward multifunctional applications in the emerging
   fields of flexible electronics, wearable sensors, energy storage,
   conversion and harvesting.},

   Hydrophilic graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets are attractive fillers for
   the preparation of composite membranes for water purification. However,
   strategies that can fully exploit the advantages and remedy the
   drawbacks of GO nanosheets are still needed. In this work, UiO-66 was
   specifically anchored to the GO layers as a porous modifier. The
   incorporated Ui0-66 can effectively prevent the GO layers from stacking
   and introduce unique properties into the composite (UiO-66@GO). A series
   of novel composite membranes were prepared with the obtained UiO-66@GO
   composite and polyethersulfone (PES). As a result, the prepared
   composite membranes (UiO-66@GO/PES) exhibit high hydrophilicity and
   water purification performance. Especially, the water flux of composite
   membrane with 3.0 wt\% UiO-66@GO loading shows an increase of 351\% and
   78\% respectively in comparison with that of the PES and GO/PES
   membranes. Moreover, the UiO-66@GO/PES membranes exhibit good solute
   rejection and impressive antifouling performance, which is appealing for
   the application of industrial water purification. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {Among many separation membranes reported to date, the favorable polymer
   affinity and unique physio-chemical performances of metal-organic
   frameworks (MOFs) including ultra-high surface area, regular and highly
   controlled porosity have drawn widespread attention in industrial and
   academic communities. In this comprehensive review, the developmental
   timeline of MOF containing membranes for water treatment were clarified.
   The removal efficiencies, elimination mechanisms, as well as possible
   influencing factors of various MOF containing membranes that applied to
   water treatment were systematically summarized. The excellent removal
   performances of MOF containing membranes for various pollutants were
   determined by the size-exclusion, pi-pi stacking interaction,
   electrostatic interaction, hydrogen bonding and so on. Since the
   progress of engineered MOF containing membranes for practical wastewater
   treatment applications lags, we further ana-lyzed the potential
   environmental application of MOF containing membranes from four aspects
   (stability of MOFs, antifouling performance of membranes, compatibility
   between MOF fillers and polymer matrix, dispersity of MOF nanoparticles
   in matrix), hoping to provide some meaningful insights. (c) 2021

   industries, due to their supreme mechanical properties and satisfactory
   tribological behavior. However, due to the dual complexity of MMNC
   systems and tribological process, the anti-friction and anti-wear
   mechanisms are unclear, and the subsequent tribological performance
   prediction and design of MMNCs are not easily possible: A critical
   up-to-date review is needed for MMNCs in tribology. This review
   systematically summarized the fabrication, manufacturing, and processing
   techniques for high-quality MMNC bulk and surface coating materials in
   tribology. Then, important factors determining the tribological
   performance (mainly anti-friction evaluation by the coefficient of
   friction (CoF) and anti-wear assessment with wear rate) in MMNCs have
   been investigated thoroughly, and the correlations have been analyzed to
   reveal their potential coupling/synergetic roles of tuning tribological
   behavior of MMNCs. Most importantly, this review combined the classical
   metal/alloy friction and wear theories and adapted them to give a
   (semi-)quantitative description of the detailed mechanisms of improved
   anti-friction and anti-wear performance in MMNCs. To guarantee the
   universal applications of these mechanisms, their links with the
   analyzed influencing factors (e.g., loading forces) and characteristic
   features like tribo-film have been clarified. This approach forms a
   solid basis for understanding, predicting, and engineering MMNCs'
   tribological behavior, instead of pure phenomenology and experimental
   observation. Later, the pathway to achieve a broader application for
   MMNCs in tribo-related fields like smart materials, biomedical devices,
   energy storage, and electronics has been concisely discussed, with the
   focus on the potential development of modeling, experimental, and
   theoretical techniques in MMNCs' tribological processes. In general,
   this review tries to elucidate the complex tribo-performances of MMNCs
   in a fundamentally universal yet straightforward way, and the discussion
   and summary in this review for the tribological performance in MMNCs
   could become a useful supplementary to and an insightful guidance for
   the current MMNC tribology study, research, and engineering innovations.},

Abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM) or 3D printing has revolutionized the
   manufacturing world through its rapid and geometrically-intricate
   capabilities as well as economic benefits. Countless businesses in
   automotive, aerospace, medical, and even food industries have adopted
   this approach over the past decade. Though this revolution has sparked
   widespread innovation with single material usage, the manufacturing
   world is constantly evolving. 3D printers now have the capability to
   create multi-material systems with performance improvements in
   user-defmable locations. This means throughout a single component,
   properties like hardness, corrosion resistance, and environmental
   adaptation can be defined in areas that require it the most. These new
   processes allow for exciting multifunctional parts to be built that were
   never possible through traditional, single material AM processes. AM of
   metals, ceramics, and polymers is currently being evaluated to combine
   multiple materials in one operation and has already produced
   never-before-produced parts. While multi-material AM is still in its
   infancy, researchers are shifting their mindset toward this unique
   approach showing that the technology is beginning to advance past a
   research and development stage into real-world applications. This review
   is intended to highlight the range of 3D printed polymer-based,
   metal-metal, and metal-ceramic applications while discussing advantages
   and challenges with additively manufactured multi-material structures.},

Abstract = {Electromagnetic (EM) absorbing and shielding composites with tunable
   absorbing behaviors based, on Ti3C2 MXenes are fabricated via HF etching
   and annealing treatment. Localized sandwich structure without
   sacrificing the original layered morphology is realized, which is
   responsible for the enhancement of EM absorbing capability in the
   X-band. The composite with SO wt \% annealed MXenes exhibits a minimum
   reflection loss of -48.4 dB at 11.6 GHz, because of the formation of
   TiO2 nanocrystals and amorphous carbon. Moreover, superior shielding
   effectiveness with high absorption effectiveness is achieved. The total
   and absorbing shielding effectiveness of Ti3C2 MXenes in a wax matrix
   with a. thickness of only 1 min reach values of 76.1 and 67.3 dB, while
   those of annealed Ti3C2 MXenes/wax composites are 32 and 24.2 dB,
   respectively. Considering the promising performance of Ti3C2 MXenes with
   the modified surface, this work is expected to open the door for the
   expanded applications of MXenes family in EM absorbing and shielding
   fields.},

   next-generation energy storage device. However, the low ionic
   conductivity of solid electrolytes and high interfacial impedance with
   electrode are the main factors to limit the development of
   all-solid-state batteries. In this work, a low resistance-integrated
   all-solid-state battery is designed with excellent electrochemical
   performance that applies the polyethylene oxide (PEO) with lithium
   bis(trifluoromethylsulphonyl)imide as both binder of cathode and matrix
   of composite electrolyte embedded with Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) nanowires
   (PLLN). The PEO in cathode and PLLN are fused at high temperature to
   form an integrated all-solid-state battery structure, which effectively
   strengthens the interface compatibility and stability between cathode
   and PLLN to guarantee high efficient ion transportation during long
   cycling. The LLZO nanowires uniformly distributed in PLLN can increase
   the ionic conductivity and mechanical strength of composite electrolyte
   efficiently, which induces the uniform deposition of lithium metal,
   thereby suppressing the lithium dendrite growth. The Li symmetric cells
   using PLLN can stably cycle for 1000 h without short circuit at 60
   degrees C. The integrated LiFePO4/PLLN/Li batteries show excellent
   cycling stability at both 60 and 45 degrees C. The study proposed a
   novel and robust battery structure with outstanding electrochemical

Abstract = {Rational construction of a profitable microstructure in carbon-based
   electromagnetic composites is becoming a promising strategy to reinforce
   their microwave absorption performance. Herein, the microstructure
   design is innovatively coupled with a metal-organic frameworks
   (MOFs)-derived method to produce hollow Co/C microspheres (Co/C-HS). The
   resultant composites combine the advantages of hollow microstructures
   and good chemical homogeneity. It is found that the pyrolysis
   temperature plays an important role in determining the electromagnetic
   properties of these hollow Co/C microspheres, where high pyrolysis
   temperature will increase relative complex permittivity and decrease
   relative complex permeability. When the pyrolysis temperature is 600
   degrees C, the sample (Co/C-HS-600) will show improved impedance
   matching and good attenuation ability, and thus an excellent microwave
   absorption performance with strong reflection loss (-66.5 dB at 17.6
   GHz) and wide response bandwidth (over -10 dB, 3.7-18.0 GHz) can be
   achieved. By comparing with Co/C composites derived from conventional
   ZIF-67, it can be validated that a hollow microstructure is greatly
   helpful to upgrade the performance by boosting dielectric loss ability
   and suppressing a negative interaction between the carbon matrix and
   incident electromagnetic waves, as well as providing multiple reflection
   behaviors. We believe that this study may open a new avenue to promote
   the electromagnetic applications of MOFs-derived carbon-based
   composites.},

   significant challenge to fulfill such goals by virtue of lower film
   thickness and less filler. Inspired by the electrostatic interaction
   between oppositely charged chitosan (CS) solution and transition metal
   carbide (MXene) slurry, here we report a series of CS/MXene alternating
   layered films by taking advantage of layer by layer assembly strategy.
   The resultant 35-mu m thick CS/MXene multilayer film presents a maximum
   EMI SE of 40.8 dB, a high specific EMI SE (SSEt) of 10, 650 dB cm2 g-1,
   together with superior thermal conductivity (6.3 W m-1 K-1) and
   excellent Joule heating capacity. Thus, this research opens up a new
   horizon for achieving satisfying EMI shielding and heat dissipation
   capacity, which will further benefit the development of MXene-based
   composite materials in next-generation electrical devices.},

Abstract = {This paper studies wave propagation in functionally graded metal foam
   plates reinforced with graphene platelets (GPLs), where various types of
   porosity and GPL distribution are taken in account. The Halpin-Tsai
   model is employed to express the material properties of metal foam
   plates reinforced with GPLs. The governing equations of wave propagation
   in metal foam plates are derived by Hamilton's principle together with
   different plate theories, upon which wave dispersion relations in plates
   are achieved. Then, the validation of proposed model is examined by
   comparing the natural frequencies calculated in present study and those
   from literature. Finally, the effects of porosity and GPL distributions,
   porosity coefficient, GPL volume fraction and geometry on wave
   dispersion relations are evaluated. (C) 2020 Elsevier Masson SAS. All

Abstract = {The development of electrocatalysts for nitrogen reduction reaction
   (NRR) at ambient conditions, with both high NH3 yield and Faradaic
   efficiency, is currently a great challenge. To this aim, a unique
   metal-organic framework (MOF) crystalline matrix with disulfide trimeric
   unit as the building block was in situ synthesized by integration of
   dynamic covalent chemistry and coordination chemistry. This MOF with
   high porosity and excellent stability could be used as a host material
   to encapsulate well-dispersed Au nanoparticles (NPs) with ultrafine size
   of 1.9 +/- 0.4 nm. After surface modification of Au@MOF by using
   organosilicone, the hydrophobic-treated Au@MOF (HT Au@MOF) composite
   shows remarkable electrocatalytic performances for NRR, with the highest
   NH3 yield of 49.5 mu g h-1 mgcat.-1 and the state-of-the-art Faradaic
   efficiency of 60.9\% in water medium at ambient conditions. The
   favorable role of MOFs with functional sulfur groups on modulating the
   active Au sites and the great effect of hydrophobic coatings on
   suppressing the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) have been
   further demonstrated. This work provides a universal strategy to design
   composite electrocatalysts for high-efficient and long-term NH3
   production.},

   manufacturing of ceramic materials, focusing on partial and full melting
   of ceramic powder by a high-energy laser beam without the use of
   binders.
   Design/methodology/approach - Selective laser sintering or melting
   (SLS/SLM) techniques are first introduced, followed by analysis of
   results from silica (SiO2), zirconia (ZrO2) and ceramic-reinforced metal
   matrix composites processed by direct laser sintering and melting.
   Findings - At the current state of technology, it is still a challenge
   to fabricate dense ceramic components directly using SLS/SLM. Critical
   challenges encountered during direct laser melting of ceramic will be
   discussed, including deposition of ceramic powder layer, interaction
   between laser and powder particles, dynamic melting and consolidation
   mechanism of the process and the presence of residual stresses in
   ceramics processed via SLS/SLM.
   Originality/value - Despite the challenges, SLS/SLM still has the
   potential in fabrication of ceramics. Additional research is needed to
   understand and establish the optimal interaction between the laser beam
   and ceramic powder bed for full density part fabrication. Looking into
   the future, other melting-based techniques for ceramic and composites
   are presented, along with their potential applications.},

Abstract = {Microporous metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) that display permanent
   porosity show great promise for a myriad of purposes. The potential
   applications of MOFs can be developed further and extended by
   encapsulating various functional species (for example, nanoparticles)
   within the frameworks. However, despite increasing numbers of reports of
   nanoparticle/MOF composites, simultaneously to control the size,
   composition, dispersed nature, spatial distribution and confinement of
   the incorporated nanoparticles within MOF matrices remains a significant
   challenge. Here, we report a controlled encapsulation strategy that
   enables surfactant-capped nanostructured objects of various sizes,
   shapes and compositions to be enshrouded by a zeolitic imidazolate
   framework (ZIF-8). The incorporated nanoparticles are well dispersed and
   fully confined within the ZIF-8 crystals. This strategy also allows the
   controlled incorporation of multiple nanoparticles within each ZIF-8
   crystallite. The as-prepared nanoparticle/ZIF-8 composites exhibit
   active (catalytic, magnetic and optical) properties that derive from the
   nanoparticles as well as molecular sieving and orientation effects that
   originate from the framework material.},

Journal = {ACTA MATERIALIA},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {68},
Pages = {150-158},
Month = {APR 15},
Abstract = {Selective laser melting (SLM) is an additive manufacturing process in
   which functional, complex parts are produced by selectively melting
   consecutive layers of powder with a laser beam. This flexibility enables
   the exploration of a wide spectrum of possibilities in creating novel
   alloys or even metal metal composites with unique microstructures. In
   this research, Ti6A14V-ELI powder was mixed with 10 wt.\% Mo powder. In
   contrast to the fully alpha ` microstructure of Ti6A14V after SLM, the
   novel microstructure consists of a beta titanium matrix with randomly
   dispersed pure Mo particles, as observed by light optical microscopy,
   scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction. Most importantly,
   the solidification mechanism changes from planar to cellular mode.
   Microstructures after heat treatment indicate that the beta phase is
   metastable and locate the beta transus at similar to 900 degrees C, and
   tensile properties are equal to or better than conventional titanium
   alloys. (C) 2014 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {Self-Healing Polymers Based on Coordination Bonds},
Journal = {ADVANCED MATERIALS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {32},
Number = {27},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Self-healing ability is an important survival feature in nature, with
   which living beings can spontaneously repair damage when wounded.
   Inspired by nature, people have designed and synthesized many
   self-healing materials by encapsulating healing agents or incorporating
   reversible covalent bonds or noncovalent interactions into a polymer
   matrix. Among the noncovalent interactions, the coordination bond is
   demonstrated to be effective for constructing highly efficient
   self-healing polymers. Moreover, with the presence of functional metal
   ions or ligands and dynamic metal-ligand bonds, self-healing polymers
   can show various functions such as dielectrics, luminescence, magnetism,
   catalysis, stimuli-responsiveness, and shape-memory behavior. Herein,
   the recent developments and achievements made in the field of
   self-healing polymers based on coordination bonds are presented. The
   advantages of coordination bonds in constructing self-healing polymers
   are highlighted, the various metal-ligand bonds being utilized in
   self-healing polymers are summarized, and examples of functional
   self-healing polymers originating from metal-ligand interactions are
   given. Finally, a perspective is included addressing the promises and
   challenges for the future development of self-healing polymers based on
   coordination bonds.},

Abstract = {Solid matrix-supported liquid metal nanoparticles have been drawing
   attention as a nanoadditive in the fabrication of electroconductive
   flexible and soft materials. The present work reports a facile, green,
   and sonochemical synthesis approach of gallium (Ga) nanoparticles
   embedded in reduced graphene oxide (RGO) under ambient conditions for
   the first time. The as-synthesized ultrasonic energy-irradiated RGO/Ga
   nanocomposite was studied using SEM, TEM, DSC, XRD, XPS, and solid-state
   NMR. Because of their electrical conductivity, RGO/Ga nanoparticles have
   been used as a conducting inclusion for a poly(
   3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene): poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) matrix
   and coated on cotton fabrics to develop a smart e-textile for
   electromagnetic (EM) radiation-shielding application. In the X-band
   (8.2-12.4 GHz) frequency range, the nanocomposites' EM
   interference-shielding efficiency was about 34 dB. Moreover, because of
   the liquid metal-graphene interfaces; the fabricated materials were
   excellent heat conductors reporting similar to 44\% increment in thermal
   conductivity compared to a bare fabric. The coated cotton textile's
   durability was tested under various conditions. The hard phase of the
   RGO/Ga nanoparticles is disseminated throughout the fabric, while the
   polymeric soft phase, that is, PEDOT:PSS macrochains, tended to
   interlink among the dispersed phases to construct a large spatial
   conducting network. Therefore, such a lightweight, flexible, and
   conductive e-fabric could be used not only for mitigating EM pollution
   but also as an alternative to commercial metallic EM wave absorbers in
   telecommunication, aerospace, and next-generation flexible electronics
   areas.},

   heavy metal},
Journal = {CHEMOSPHERE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {290},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The Mil-125(Ti)-CS nanocomposite was successfully synthesized and
   characterized by using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images,
   Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) analysis and X-ray diffraction (XRD).
   Then, to improve the membrane performance, the synthesized
   Mil-125(Ti)-CS nanocomposite was embedded into the polyethersulfone
   (PES) membrane matrix. The nanofiltration membranes were fabricated via
   phase inversion method. Presence of chitosan in the structure of
   Mil-125(Ti) has increased the compatibility of nanoparticles with the
   polymer and also improved the hydrophilicity of the resulted membranes.
   The water contact angle of bare membrane (58 degrees) was reduced to 40
   degrees by blending of 1 wt\% nanocomposite led to increasing the pure
   water flux. However, the incorporation of more than 1 wt\% of the
   nanocomposite caused the accumulation of nano composites and this was
   reduced the pore radius and permeability. The membrane containing 1 wt\%
   nano composite was displayed the highest flux recovery ratio (FRR)
   similar to 98\% in bovine serum albumin (BSA) filtration. The membranes
   containing Mil-125(Ti)-CS also showed good performance against fouling.
   The performance of membranes was evaluated by treatment of six reactive
   dyes, antibiotic (cefixime), heavy metal, NaCl and Na2SO4 solutions.
   Addition of Mil-125(Ti)-CS NPs at low concentrations resulted in
   membranes with high pure water flux, higher separation efficiency, and
   remarkable anti-fouling behavior.},

Abstract = {The micropatterning of conductive composites is of great importance for
   the integration of elastic conductors with functional micro-geometries
   in a stretchable platform. We present a simple and rapid micropatteming
   method for conductive composites that relies on single-step contact
   transfer printing (sCTP). A conductive polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)
   composite is readily synthesized by dispersing conductive carbon black
   nanoparticles into a PDMS matrix and is easily patterned on insulative
   PDMS substrates with negligible dimensional errors by the proposed
   method. In addition to simplicity and accuracy in fabrication, superior
   process scalability is revealed through investigation of both
   multiple-stack and large-area patterning approaches. We also demonstrate
   an all-elastomeric-platformed piezoresistive strain sensor capable of
   measuring higher tensile strains compared to conventional metal foil
   gauges, with highly linear, good cyclic electrical performance, and
   mechanical robustness. As a potential application, we integrate the
   strain sensors onto a glove to measure the motions of human fingers in
   real time. We further demonstrate a rosette-type gauge that can detect
   both the magnitude and direction of the principal strains with
   patterning accuracy and uniformity facilitated by the proposed sCTP
   technique. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   (P{[}VDF-TrFE-CFE]) polymer embedded with 2D Ti3C2Tx nanosheets reaches
   a dielectric permittivity as high as 105 near the percolation limit of
   about 15.0 wt \% MXene loading, which surpasses all previously reported
   composites made of carbon-based fillers in the same polymer. With up to
   10 wt \% MXene loading, the dielectric loss of the MXene/P(VDF-TrFE-CFE)
   composite indicates only an approximately 5-fold increase (from 0.06 to
   0.35), while the dielectric constant increased by 25 times over the same
   composition range. Furthermore, the ratio of permittivity to loss factor
   of the MXene polymer composite is superior to that of all previously
   reported fillers in this same polymer. The dielectric constant
   enhancement effect is demonstrated to exist in other polymers as well
   when loaded with MXene. We show that the dielectric constant enhancement
   is largely due to the charge accumulation caused by the formation of
   microscopic dipoles at the surfaces between the MXene sheets and the
   polymer matrix under an external applied electric field.},

   bone with materials including polymer, ceramics, metals, cells and
   growth factors. Composites consisting of polymer-ceramics, best mimic
   the natural functions of bone. Alginate, an anionic polymer owing
   enormous biomedical applications, is gaining importance particularly in
   bone tissue engineering due to its biocompatibility and gel forming
   properties. Several composites such as alginate-polymer (PLGA, PEG and
   chitosan), alginate-protein (collagen and gelatin), alginate-ceramic,
   alginate-bioglass, alginate-biosilica, alginate-bone morphogenetic
   protein-2 and RGD peptides composite have been investigated till date.
   These alginate composites show enhanced biochemical significance in
   terms of porosity, mechanical strength, cell adhesion, biocompatibility,
   cell proliferation, alkaline phosphatase increase, excellent
   mineralization and osteogenic differentiation. Hence, alginate based
   composite biomaterials will be promising for bone tissue regeneration.
   This review will provide a broad overview of alginate preparation and
   its applications towards bone tissue engineering. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

   nanoparticle incorporated TFNC membranes for application in water

   graphene-oxide), metal and metal oxides-based (silver, copper, titanium

   nano-sized fillers like silica, halloysite, zeolite and cellulose-nano

   terms of water flux, salt rejection, chlorine resistance, and
   anti-fouling properties of TFNC membranes relative to the typical
   thin-film composite (TFC) membranes. Here, we also focus on the
   environmental impact, commercialization, and future scope of TFNC
   membranes. From the current review, it is evident that the nanomaterials
   possess exclusive properties, which can contribute to the advancement of
   high-tech nanocomposite membranes with improved capabilities for

   parameters for materials, determining the response of materials to
   electromagnetic waves or electrical field; its value is generally
   positive. In fact, dielectric constant can also be negative, regarded as
   supernormal performance to some degree. The negative dielectric property
   has become research hotspot as an essential key for constructing
   metamaterials, showing unique and exotic electromagnetic properties not
   existing in naturally occurring materials, such as negative refraction,
   perfect troubles, and reverse Doppler effect. Recently, the feasibility
   is demonstrated to achieve negative dielectric property in conventional
   heterogeneous composites rather than periodic artificial arrays; drawing
   great attention from researchers in material science and engineering,
   many advances have been made and can promote the development of
   metamaterials and conventional electromagnetic functional materials.
   Here, we reviewed the recent advances in negative dielectric property
   designed in some heterogeneous composites, including metal composites,
   carbon composites, ceramic composites, conducting polymer. Besides,
   various strategies, including designing different microstructures,
   changing the working temperatures, choosing flexible matrix or fillers,
   electro-magnetic coupling, were summarized to precisely adjust negative
   dielectric property. Finally, the question unsolved and perspectives
   about negative dielectric property are put forward; we expect to shed
   light on the mechanism of negative dielectric property as well as its
   relationship with the material design in composition and microstructure.},

Title = {FeSe2/nitrogen-doped carbon as anode material for Potassium-ion

Journal = {CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL},

Abstract = {Potassium-ion batteries (PIBs) have aroused intensive interests as a
   promising alternative to lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) for large-scale
   energy storage, however, the lack of high performance anode material is
   one of the key challenges for their development, which is mainly caused
   by the large size of potassium ions inducing severe volume change and
   pulverization of anode materials. Here, we report a FeSe2/nitrogen-doped
   carbon (FeSe2/NC) composite with a structure of N-doped carbon-coated
   FeSe2 nanoparticles anchored on thin carbon nanosheets matrix as an
   anode material for PIBs. Benefiting from the nanosized particles
   reducing the ion diffusion length, the protective carbon coating
   alleviating volume fluctuation, and the carbon nanosheets matrix
   facilitating electrons transport, the FeSe2/NC electrode delivers high
   capacities of 434 mA h g(-1) after 70 cycles at 0.1 A g(-1), and 301 mA
   h g(-1) after 250 cycles at 1.0 A g(-1). Meanwhile, the potassium
   storage mechanism of FeSe2 has been preliminarily investigated by using
   ex situ X-ray diffraction technique and high-resolution transmission
   electron microscopy. The remarkable performance and easy preparation
   demonstrate the great promise of FeSe2/NC composite as a potential anode
   material for PIBs.},

Title = {Utilization of Improved Machine Learning Method Based on Artificial
   Hummingbird Algorithm to Predict the Tribological Behavior of Cu-Al2O3
   Nanocomposites Synthesized by In Situ Method},

Abstract = {This paper presents a machine learning model to predict the effect of
   Al2O3 nanoparticles content on the wear rates in Cu-Al2O3 nanocomposite
   prepared using in situ chemical technique. The model developed is a
   modification of the random vector functional link (RVFL) algorithm using
   artificial hummingbird algorithm (AHA). The objective of using AHA is
   used to find the optimal configuration of RVFL to enhance the prediction
   of Al2O3 nanoparticles. The preparation of the composite was done using
   aluminum nitrate that was added to a solution containing scattered
   copper nitrate. After that, the powders of CuO and Al2O3 were obtained,
   and the leftover liquid was removed using a thermal treatment at 850
   degrees C for 1 h. The powders were consolidated using compaction and
   sintering processes. The microhardness of the nanocomposite with 12.5\%
   Al2O3 content is 2.03-fold times larger than the pure copper, while the
   wear rate of the same composite is reduced, reaching 55\% lower than
   pure copper. These improved properties are attributed to the presence of
   Al2O3 nanoparticles and their homogenized distributions inside the
   matrix. The developed RVFl-AHA model was able to predict the wear rates
   of all the prepared composites at different wear load and speed, with
   very good accuracy, reaching nearly 100\% and 99.5\% using training and
   testing, respectively, in terms of coefficient of determination R-2.},

  abstract                   = {While metal is the most common conductive constituent element in the
   preparation of metamaterials, one-dimensional conductive carbon
   nanotubes (CNTs) provide alternative building blocks. Here alumina
   (Al2O3) nanocomposites with multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs)
   uniformly dispersed in the alumina matrix were prepared by hot-pressing
   sintering. As the MWCNT content increased, the formed conductive MWCNT
   networks led to the occurrence of the percolation phenomenon and a
   change of the conductive mechanism. Two different types of negative
   permittivity (i.e., resonance-induced and plasma-like) were observed in
   the composites. The resonance-induced negative permittivity behavior in
   the composite with a low nanotube content was ascribed to the induced
   electric dipole generated from the isolated MWCNTs. The frequency
   dispersions of such negative permittivity can be fitted well by the
   Lorentz model, while the observed plasma-like negative permittivity
   behavior in the composites with MWCNT content exceeding the percolation
   threshold could be well explained by the low frequency plasmonic state
   generated from conductive nanotube networks using the Drude model. This
   work is favorable to revealing the generation mechanism of negative
   permittivity behavior and will greatly facilitate the practical
   applications of metamaterials.},

Abstract = {Pervaporation is a molecular separation membrane technology for
   selective permeation of water or organic compounds from organic-water
   mixtures or organic-organic mixtures. The pervaporation process is
   controlled by thermodynamic partitioning and kinetic mobility of
   molecules in the membrane. The chemical property and morphology of
   membrane materials can be engineered to tailor the complementary
   sorption and diffusion coefficient and selectivity, and thus the
   permeability (or flux) and selectivity (or separation factor). In this
   review, we highlight the latest progresses of pervaporation membrane
   materials, including pure polymeric membranes and inorganic membranes,
   as well as mixed-matrix membranes and emerging two-dimensional-material
   membranes. Challenges and future opportunities in materials design,
   fabrication and structure-performance relationship are identified to
   develop next-generation pervaporation membranes with enhanced separation
   efficiency.},

   The heterogenization of homogeneous metal complexes on solid supports
   presents an efficient strategy for bridging homogeneous catalysts with
   industrially-preferred heterogeneous catalysts; however, a series of
   drawbacks restrict their implementation in olefin polymerization,
   particularly for copolymerization with polar comonomers. In this
   contribution, we report an ionic anchoring strategy that is highly
   versatile, generally applicable to different systems, and enables strong
   catalyst-support interactions while tolerating various polar functional
   groups. In addition to greatly enhanced polymerization properties, the
   supported catalysts achieved higher comonomer incorporation than their
   unsupported counterparts. This strategy enabled efficient polymerization
   at high temperatures at large scale and great control over product
   morphology, and the facile synthesis of polyolefin composites. More
   importantly, the dispersion of different fillers in the polyolefin
   matrix produced great material properties even at low composite
   loadings. It is expected that this strategy will find applications in
   different catalytic systems and the synthesis of advanced engineering
   materials.},

Abstract = {Micromagnets dispersed in a polymer matrix are used to realize a soft
   magnetoelastic generator with high magnetomechanical coupling factor,
   used for wearable and implantable power generation and sensing
   applications.
   The magnetoelastic effect-the variation of the magnetic properties of a
   material under mechanical stress-is usually observed in rigid alloys,
   whose mechanical modulus is significantly different from that of human
   tissues, thus limiting their use in bioelectronics applications. Here,
   we observed a giant magnetoelastic effect in a soft system based on
   micromagnets dispersed in a silicone matrix, reaching a
   magnetomechanical coupling factor indicating up to four times more
   enhancement than in rigid counterparts. The results are interpreted
   using a wavy chain model, showing how mechanical stress changes the
   micromagnets' spacing and dipole alignment, thus altering the magnetic
   field generated by the composite. Combined with liquid-metal coils
   patterned on polydimethylsiloxane working as a magnetic induction layer,
   the soft magnetoelastic composite is used for stretchable and
   water-resistant magnetoelastic generators adhering conformably to human
   skin. Such devices can be used as wearable or implantable power
   generators and biomedical sensors, opening alternative avenues for
   human-body-centred applications.},

   Nevertheless, excessive dendrite growth, infinite relative dimension
   change, severe side reactions, and limited power output severely impede
   their practical applications. Although exciting progress has been made
   to solve parts of the above issues, a versatile solution is still
   absent. Here, a Li-ion conductive framework was developed as a stable
   ``host{''} and efficient surface protection to address the multifaceted
   problems, which is a significant step forward compared with previous
   host concepts. This was fulfilled by reacting overstoichiometry of Li
   with SiO. The as-formed LixSi-Li2O matrix would not only enable constant
   electrode-level volume, but also protect the embedded Li from direct
   exposure to electrolyte. Because uniform Li nucleation and deposition
   can be fulfilled owing to the high-density active Li domains, the
   as-obtained nanocomposite electrode exhibits low polarization, stable
   cycling, and high-power output (up to 10mA/cm(2)) even in carbonate
   electrolytes. The Li-S prototype cells further exhibited highly improved
   capacity retention under high-power operation (similar to 600 mAh/g at
   6.69 mA/cm(2)). The all-around improvement on electrochemical
   performance sheds light on the effectiveness of the design principle for
   developing safe and stable Li metal anodes.},

   porous-carbon-related nanostructured functional materials. For the first
   time, a Cu-based MOF, i.e., Cu-NPMOF is used, whose linkers contain
   nitrogen and phosphorus heteroatoms, as a single precursor and template
   to prepare novel Cu3P nanoparticles (NPs) coated by a N,P-codoped carbon
   shell that is extended to a hierarchical porous carbon matrix with
   identical uniform N and P doping (termed Cu3P@NPPC) as an
   electrocatalyst. Cu3P@NPPC demonstrates outstanding activity for both
   the hydrogen evolution and oxygen reduction reaction, representing the
   first example of a Cu3P-based bifunctional catalyst for
   energy-conversion reactions. The high performances are ascribed to the
   high specific surface area, the synergistic effects of the Cu3P NPs with
   intrinsic activity, the protection of the carbon shell, and the
   hierarchical porous carbon matrix doped by multiheteroatoms. This
   strategy of using a diverse MOF as a structural and compositional

Abstract = {In this work, strengthening of 316L stainless steel was achieved through
   addition of 1 and 3 wt\% TiC nano particles. The TiC nanoparticles and
   316L powders were mixed using low energy ball milling and then processed
   by selective laser melting. The grains are significantly refined from
   16.8 mu m to 6.9 mu m with the addition of 3 wt\% TiC nanoparticles.
   Addition of 1 and 3 wt\% TiC nanoparticles remarkably increased yield
   strength (694 MPa and 773 MPa) and ultimate tensile strength (888 MPa
   and 988 MPa). Meanwhile, the tensile elongation was kept at a high level
   (47\% and 32\%). The strength enhancement primarily results from Orowan
   strengthening by the nanoparticles, and the reduction of ductility is
   related to the suppression of twinning induced plasticity.},

Abstract = {Additive Manufacturing (AM) is the significantly progressing field in
   terms of methods, materials, and performance of fabricated parts.
   Periodical evaluation on the understanding of AM processes and its
   evolution is needed since the field is growing rapidly. To address this
   requirement, this paper presents a detailed review of the Additive
   Manufacturing (AM) methods, materials used, and challenges associated
   with them. A critical review of the state of art materials in the
   categories such as metals and alloys, polymers, ceramics, and
   biomaterials are presented along with their applications, benefits, and
   the problems associated with the formation of microstructures,
   mechanical properties, and controlling process parameters. The
   perspectives and the status of different materials on the fabrication of
   thin-walled structures using AM techniques have also been discussed.
   Additionally, the main challenges with AM techniques such as inaccuracy,
   surface quality, reinforcement distribution, and other common problems
   identified from the literature are presented. On the whole, this paper
   provides a comprehensive outlook on AM techniques, challenges, and
   future research directions.},

Title = {FeCo alloy/N, S dual-doped carbon composite as a high-performance
   bifunctional catalyst in an advanced rechargeable zinc-air battery},

Abstract = {The rational design and development of cost-effective, high-performance,
   and stable bifunctional oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen
   evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts are essential for rechargeable
   zinc-air batteries. Herein, a novel FeCo composite composed of alloy
   nanoparticles embedded in an N, S dual-doped carbon matrix (FeCo/NSC)
   was prepared via one-step carbonization of amphiphilic
   dodecanethiol-metal salts wrapped in carbon nitride (C3N4). The compact
   combination of dual metal-alloys and dual-doped carbon endowed the
   composite with the active sites for the ORR and OER, achieving efficient
   electrical transmission and highly efficient bifunctional catalytic
   performance. The obtained FeCo-1/NSC catalyst exhibited excellent
   electrocatalytic activity with a half-wave potential of 0.82 V (vs. RHE)
   for the ORR and a low overpotential of 0.325 V at 10 mA cm(-2) for the
   OER. The liquid Zn-air battery with FeCo-1/NSC as an air electrode
   displayed excellent charge-discharge performance, high power density,
   and robust charge-discharge stability for 150 h compared to the 20\%
   Pt/C + RuO2 counterpart. Furthermore, the FeCo-1/NSC-based flexible
   solid-state Zn-air battery exhibited a higher power density and good
   charge-discharge stability over 10 h of operation. Thus, a promising
   strategy for bifunctional electrocatalyst development as part of
   rechargeable and wearable Zn-air batteries was provided. (C) 2020

Title = {Soft material for soft actuators},
Journal = {NATURE COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {8},
Month = {SEP 19},
Abstract = {Inspired by natural muscle, a key challenge in soft robotics is to
   develop self-contained electrically driven soft actuators with high
   strain density. Various characteristics of existing technologies, such
   as the high voltages required to trigger electroactive polymers (> 1KV),
   low strain (< 10\%) of shape memory alloys and the need for external
   compressors and pressure-regulating components for hydraulic or
   pneumatic fluidicelastomer actuators, limit their practicality for
   untethered applications. Here we show a single self-contained soft
   robust composite material that combines the elastic properties of a
   polymeric matrix and the extreme volume change accompanying liquid-vapor
   transition. The material combines a high strain (up to 900\%) and
   correspondingly high stress (up to 1.3 MPa) with low density (0.84 g
   cm(-3)). Along with its extremely low cost (about 3 cent per gram),
   simplicity of fabrication and environment-friendliness, these properties
   could enable new kinds of electrically driven entirely soft robots.},

Title = {Noble-metal-free MoS2 co-catalyst decorated UiO-66/CdS hybrids for
   efficient photocatalytic H-2 production},
Journal = {APPLIED CATALYSIS B-ENVIRONMENTAL},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {166},
Pages = {445-453},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {A novel and highly efficient photocatalyst MoS2/UiO-66/CdS has been
   fabricated through dual modification of CdS with metal-organic framework
   (MOF) UiO-66 and MoS2. UiO-66 was firstly introduced as a matrix for the
   well-dispersed growth of CdS, resulting in large active surface area.
   Moreover, the heterojunction between UiO-66 and CdS promoted the
   separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs. MoS2 as cocatalyst was
   further deposited on UiO-66/CdS via a facile photo-assisted approach.
   This technique made CdS, UiO-66 and MoS2 undergo an intimate interfacial
   interaction, setting a stage for rapid transfer of photogenerated
   electrons between the components of the composite, and hence
   dramatically increased the synergetic catalytic effect of UiO-66, MoS2
   and CdS. Without a noble-metal cocatalyst, the obtained MoS2/UiO-66/CdS
   composites functioned as high-performance photocatalysts for H-2
   evolution under irisible light irradiation. An unusual H-2 production
   rate of 650 mu mol h(-1) has been reached by the sample of
   MoS2/UiO-66/CdS when the content of UiO-66 is 50 wt\% and MoS2 is 1.5
   wt\%. This is nearly 60 times higher than the H-2 evolution rate with
   pure CdS and also exceeds that of Pt/UiO-66/CdS under the same reaction
   conditions. More importantly, in sharp contrast with the obvious
   deterioration in photoactivity of pure CdS, the MoS2/UiO-66/CdS
   displayed significantly enhanced photostability. This study clearly
   demonstrates the benefit of using MOFs as ideal support and MoS2 as
   cocatalyst to work cooperatively for enhancing the photocatalytic H-2
   evolution activity and stability of semiconductors. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {In recent years, much progress has been made on the development of
   aerospace materials for structural and engine applications. Alloys, such
   as Al-based alloys, Mg-based alloys, Ti-based alloys, and Ni-based
   alloys, are developed for aerospace industry with outstanding
   advantages. Composite materials, the innovative materials, are taking
   more and more important roles in aircrafts. However, recent aerospace
   materials still face some major challenges, such as insufficient
   mechanical properties, fretting wear, stress corrosion cracking, and
   corrosion. Consequently, extensive studies have been conducted to
   develop the next generation aerospace materials with superior mechanical
   performance and corrosion resistance to achieve improvements in both
   performance and life cycle cost. This review focuses on the following
   topics: (1) materials requirements in design of aircraft structures and
   engines, (2) recent advances in the development of aerospace materials,
   (3) challenges faced by recent aerospace materials, and (4) future
   trends in aerospace materials.},

Title = {Annealing coordinates the deformation of shear band to improve the
   microstructure difference and simultaneously promote the
   strength-plasticity of composite plate},
Journal = {MATERIALS \& DESIGN},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {When rolling aluminum (Al)/magnesium (Mg)/aluminum (Al) composite plates
   with large reduction, there are often differences in the matrix
   structure and hard brittle properties of interfacial intermetallic
   compounds, which have a negative impact on the mechanical properties.
   Therefore, it is necessary to adjust the evolution of the diffusion
   layer and homogenize the internal structure of the metal plate by
   annealing to achieve the best performance. In this study, Al/Mg/Al
   composite plates were formed by hard-plate rolling (HPR) with a single
   pass of 60\% reduction and annealed. The results show that the tensile
   strength (UTS) of rolled plate is 235.4 MPa and the elongation to
   failure (A) is 6.2\%. It is found that after annealing at 300 degrees C
   for 1 h, the interface bonding property is suitable, the microstructure
   is gradually uniformly refined by the joint action of shear band
   expansion and twin induced static recrystallization, the UTS reaches
   265.1 MPa. The A is increased by 18.5\%. In conclusion, annealing
   treatment can significantly improve the microstructure and connection
   strength of hard-plate rolling Al/Mg/Al composite plates and provide
   scientific guidance and technical support for the forming and
   manufacturing high-performance lightweight composite plates. (C) 2022

Title = {Binary synergistic enhancement of dielectric and microwave absorption
   properties: A composite of arm symmetrical PbS dendrites and
   polyvinylidene fluoride},
Journal = {NANO RESEARCH},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {10},

Abstract = {Arm symmetrical PbS dendrite (ASD-PbS) nanostructures can be prepared on
   a large scale by a solvothermal process. The ASD-PbSs exhibit a
   three-dimensional symmetrical structure, and each dendrite grows
   multiple branches on the main trunk. Such unique ASD-PbSs can be
   combined with polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) to prepare a composite
   material with enhanced dielectric and microwave-absorption properties. A
   detailed investigation of the dependence of the dielectric properties on
   the frequency and temperature shows that the ASD-PbS/PVDF composite has
   an ultrahigh dielectric constant and a low percolation threshold. The
   dielectric permittivity is as high as 1,548 when the concentration of
   the ASD-PbS filler reaches 13.79 vol.\% at 102 Hz, which is 150 times
   larger than that of pure PVDF, while the composite is as flexible as
   pure PVDF. Furthermore, the maximum reflection loss can reach-36.69 dB
   at 16.16 GHz with a filler content of only 2 wt.\%, which indicates
   excellent microwave absorption. The loss mechanism is also elucidated.
   The present work demonstrates that the addition of metal sulfide
   microcrystals to polymer matrix composites provides a useful method for
   improving the dielectric and microwave-absorption properties.},

Abstract = {By-products management from industrial and natural (agriculture,
   aviculture, and others) activities and products are critical for
   promoting sustainability, reducing pollution, increasing storage space,
   minimising landfills, reducing energy consumption, and facilitating a
   circular economy. One of the sustainable waste management approaches is
   utilising them in developing biocomposites. Biocomposites are
   eco-friendly materials because of their sustainability and environmental
   benefits that have comparable performance properties to the synthetic
   counterparts. Biocomposites can be developed from both renewable and
   industrial waste, making them both energy efficient and sustainable.
   Because of their low weight and high strength, biocomposite materials in
   applications such as automobiles can minimise fuel consumption and
   conserve energy. Furthermore, biocomposites in energy-based applications
   could lead to savings in both the economy and energy consumption.
   Herein, a review of biocomposites made from various wastes and their
   related key properties (e.g. mechanical and fire) are provided. The
   article systematically highlights the individual wastes/by-products from
   agriculture and materials processing industries for composites
   manufacturing in terms of their waste components (materials),
   modifications, resultant properties, applications and energy efficiency.
   Finally, a perspective for the future of biowastes and industrial wastes
   in polymer composites is discussed.},

   shielding applications are reviewed. EMI shielding refers to the
   capability of a material to protect from electromagnetic fields (EMFs)
   generated by electronic devices. Traditionally conducting metals are
   used in EMI shielding applications, which are slowly being replaced by
   conducting polymer based shields. This review is narrowly focused on
   understanding the approaches related to porous high EMI shielding
   composite materials that have very low density values. While metallic
   fillers can increase the EMI shielding capabilities of polymers, they
   also increase the weight, which can be offset by inducing the porosity
   in the matrix. Porosity is found to be effective in providing higher
   shielding effectiveness at low filler volume fraction due to
   concentrating the filler in the solid polymers. However, use of gas
   porosity results in composites with low mechanical properties. This
   problem can be alleviated to some extent by reinforcing polymer foams
   with lightweight conductivefillers such as carbon nanofibers (CNFs),
   carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and graphene. But the properties of pores such
   aspore size and distribution cannot be effectively controlled in such
   cases. Syntactic foams containing hollow particle fillers seem to be the
   best combination of EMI shielding capabilities and mechanical
   properties. These composites can be either filled with a second phase
   conducting filler, or hollow particles can be coated with a conducting
   layer, or hollow particles made of conducting materials can be used as
   fillers. The hollow particle wall thickness and volume fractions can be
   optimized to obtain the desired combination of properties in syntactic
   foams to enable their multifunctional applications.},

Abstract = {The implementation of membrane-based separations in the petrochemical
   industry has the potential to reduce energy consumption significantly
   relative to conventional separation processes(1). Achieving this goal,
   however, requires the development of new membrane materials with greater
   selectivity, permeability and stability than available at present. Here,
   we report composite materials consisting of nanocrystals of
   metal-organic frameworks dispersed within a high-performance polyimide,
   which can exhibit enhanced selectivity for ethylene over ethane, greater
   ethylene permeability and improved membrane stability. Our results
   suggest that framework-polymer interactions reduce chain mobility of the
   polymer while simultaneously boosting membrane separation performance.
   The increased stability, or plasticization resistance, is expected to
   improve membrane utility under real process conditions for petrochemical
   separations and natural gas purification. Furthermore, this approach can
   be broadly applied to numerous polymers that encounter aggressive
   environments, potentially making gas separations possible that were
   previously inaccessible to membranes.},

Title = {Identification of the Intrinsic Dielectric Properties of Metal Single
   Atoms for Electromagnetic Wave Absorption},
Journal = {NANO-MICRO LETTERS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {Atomically dispersed metals on N-doped carbon supports (M-NxCs) have
   great potential applications in various fields. However, a precise
   understanding of the definitive relationship between the configuration
   of metal single atoms and the dielectric loss properties of M-NxCs at
   the atomic-level is still lacking. Herein, we report a general approach
   to synthesize a series of three-dimensional (3D) honeycomb-like M-NxC
   (M=Mn, Fe, Co, Cu, or Ni) containing metal single atoms. Experimental
   results indicate that 3D M-NxCs exhibit a greatly enhanced dielectric
   loss compared with that of the NC matrix. Theoretical calculations
   demonstrate that the density of states of the d orbitals near the Fermi
   level is significantly increased and additional electrical dipoles are
   induced due to the destruction of the symmetry of the local
   microstructure, which enhances conductive loss and dipolar polarization
   loss of 3D M-NxCs, respectively. Consequently, these 3D M-NxCs exhibit
   excellent electromagnetic wave absorption properties, outperforming the
   most commonly reported absorbers. This study systematically explains the
   mechanism of dielectric loss at the atomic level for the first time and
   is of significance to the rational design of high-efficiency
   electromagnetic wave absorbing materials containing metal single atoms.},

  abstract                   = {Engineering materials are expected to contain physical and mechanical
   properties to meet the requirements and to improve the functionality
   according to their application area. In this direction, hybrid
   composites stand as an excellent option to fulfill these requests thanks
   to their production procedure. Despite the powder metallurgy method that
   allows for manufacturing products with high accuracy, machining
   operations are still required to obtain a final product. On the other
   hand, such materials are characterized with uncertainties in the
   structure and extremely hard reinforcement particles that aggravate the
   machinability. One of the prominent solutions for better machinability
   of composites is to use evolutionary cooling and lubricating strategies.
   This study focuses on the determination of tribological behavior of
   Cu-based, B-Ti-SiCP reinforced, about 5\% wt. hybrid composites under
   milling of several environments, such as dry, minimum quantity
   lubrication (MQL)-assisted and cryogenic LN2-assisted. Comprehensive
   evaluation was carried out by considering tool wear, temperature,
   energy, surface roughness, surface texture and chips morphology as the
   machinability characteristics. The findings of this experimental
   research showed that cryogenic cooling improves the tribological
   conditions by reducing the cutting temperatures, flank wear tendency and
   required cutting energy. On the other hand, MQL based lubricating
   strategy provided the best tool wear index and surface characteristics,
   i.e., surface roughness and surface topography, which is related to
   spectacular ability in developing the friction conditions in the
   deformation zones. Therefore, this paper offers a novel milling strategy
   for Cu-based hybrid composites with the help of environmentally-friendly
   techniques.},

   been attracting extensive interest due to the diversity of host-guest
   coordination and unique structure at micro/nano-meters level. However,
   the accurate adjustment of metal-semiconductor interfaces construct
   remains a great challenge. Here, a novel hierarchical multi-interfacial
   Ni@C@ZnO microsphere with special Schottky contact structure was
   successfully fabricated after annealed the bimetallic Ni-Zn-MOF
   precursor. The unique yolk-shell microsphere was assembled together by
   the core-shell Ni@C micro-units and ZnO flakes. The uniformly dispersed
   ZnO flakes were anchored inside the hierarchical conductive carbon
   matrix. The yolk-shell Ni@C@ZnO materials displayed high-performance
   microwave absorption after the micro-nano structure and interfacial
   design were optimized. In particular, with a low mass additive amount of
   only 25\%, the maximum reflection loss (RL) reached -55.8 dB at 2.5 mm,
   and the effective absorption bandwidth (RL <= -10 dB) covered as wide as
   4.1 GHz. The excellent microwave absorption performance could be
   attributed to the polarized interfaces of Ni-C-ZnO, which contributes a
   metallic/semiconductor barrier. Thus, both magnetic-dielectric
   synergetic effect and interfacial polarization might lead to an evident
   absorption. This novel lightweight magnetic MOF-derived composites
   promise great potential in the practical microwave absorption fields.},

   degrade back to the bulk phase, which undermines their potential for
   LEDs. Here we demonstrate that perovskite nanocrystals stabilized in
   metal-organic framework (MOF) thin films make bright and stable LEDs.
   The perovskite nanocrystals in MOF thin films can maintain the
   photoluminescence and electroluminescence against continuous ultraviolet
   irradiation, heat and electrical stress. As revealed by optical and
   X-ray spectroscopy, the strong emission originates from localized
   carrier recombination. Bright LEDs made from perovskite-MOF nanocrystals
   are demonstrated with a maximum external quantum efficiency of over 15\%
   and a high brightness of over 10(5) cd m(-2) after the device reaches
   stabilization. During LED operation, the nanocrystals can be well
   preserved, free of ion migration or crystal merging through protection
   by the MOF matrix, leading to a stable performance over 50 hours.
   The use of metal-organic frameworks helps protect perovskite
   nanocrystals, resulting in bright, stable light-emitting diodes.},

Abstract = {Transition metal doped carbon materials are recognized as promising
   sensing platforms for glucose detection. Herein, a simple strategy
   involving crystallinity, nanostructure engineering, and pyrolysis was
   developed for constructing well-defined Ni nanoparticle embedded on
   nanoporous carbon nanorods (Ni/NCNs). A three-dimensional nickel-based
   metal-organic framework (Ni-MOF) was used as both a self-sacrificing
   template and precursor. Due to the synergistic effects between the
   uniformly dispersed Ni nanoparticles and the nanoporous carbon matrix,
   the as-prepared Ni/NCNs exhibited remarkable electro-chemical activity.
   The fabricated Ni/NCNs glucose sensor showed excellent electrocatalytic
   performance with ultra-low limit of detection, wide linear detection
   ranges, fast response times (within 1.6 s), superior stability, and
   anti-interference characteristics. Moreover, the Ni/NCNs sensing
   platform was successfully applied to analyze glucose concentrations in
   human blood samples. These results showed that Ni/NCNs hold potential
   applications in developing enzyme-free glucose sensors. (C) 2020

  abstract                   = {The presence of heavy metals in the industrial effluents has recently
   been a challenging issue for human health. Efficient removal of heavy
   metal ions from environment is one of the most important issues from
   biological and environmental point of view, and many studies have been
   devoted to investigate the environmental behavior of nanoscale
   zerovalent iron (NZVI) for the removal of toxic heavy metal ions,
   present both in the surface and underground wastewater. The aim of this
   review is to show the excellent removal capacity and environmental
   remediation of NZVI-based materials for various heavy metal ions. A new
   look on NZVI-based materials (e.g., modified or matrix-supported NZVI
   materials) and possible interaction mechanism (e.g., adsorption,
   reduction and oxidation) and the latest environmental application. The
   effects of various environmental conditions (e.g., pH, temperature,
   coexisting oxy-anions and cations) and potential problems for the
   removal of heavy metal ions on NZVI-based materials with the DFT
   theoretical calculations and EXAFS technology are discussed. Research
   shows that NZVI-based materials have satisfactory removal capacities for
   heavy metal ions and play an important role in the environmental
   pollution cleanup. Possible improvement of NZVI-based materials and
   potential areas for future applications in environment remediation are
   also proposed.},

  abstract                   = {Successful materials design for bone-tissue engineering requires an
   understanding of the composition and structure of native bone tissue, as
   well as appropriate selection of biomimetic natural or tunable synthetic
   materials (biomaterials), such as polymers, bioceramics, metals and
   composites. Scalable fabrication technologies that enable control over
   construct architecture at multiple length scales, including
   three-dimensional printing and electric-field-assisted techniques, can
   then be employed to process these biomaterials into suitable forms for
   bone-tissue engineering. In this Review, we provide an overview of
   materials-design considerations for bone-tissue-engineering applications
   in both disease modelling and treatment of injuries and disease in
   humans. We outline the materials-design pathway from implementation
   strategy through selection of materials and fabrication methods to
   evaluation. Finally, we discuss unmet needs and current challenges in
   the development of ideal materials for bone-tissue regeneration and
   highlight emerging strategies in the field.
   Design of bone-tissue-engineering materials involves consideration of
   multiple, often conflicting, requirements. This Review discusses these
   considerations and highlights scalable technologies that can fabricate
   natural and synthetic biomaterials (polymers, bioceramics, metals and
   composites) into forms suitable for bone-tissue-engineering applications

Title = {CuNi alloy/ carbon foam nanohybrids as high-performance electromagnetic
   wave absorbers},
Journal = {CARBON},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {172},
Pages = {488-496},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Three-dimensional (3D) carbon foams (CF) embedded with CuNi alloy
   nanoparticles have been constructed for electromagnetic wave absorption
   application. In the synthetic procedure, Ni2+ and Cu2+ were firstly
   adsorbed into the melamine foam (MF) to form Ni2+-Cu2+/MF composites,
   which were then subject to the pyrolysis treatment, resulting in the
   production of mesoporous CuNi alloy/CF. The texture characterizations
   indicate that CuNi alloy nanoparticles whose size distribution was
   20-600 nm were embedded on the surface of the CF. Other than previous
   carbon structures, the CuNi/CF with CuNi alloy nanoparticles evenly
   distributed into the 3D carbon matrix inherits the characteristic of the
   3D structured N-rich MF, which induces masses of dipole polarization,
   interfacial polarization and electromagnetic wave scattering. The CuNi11
   exhibits excellent electromagnetic wave absorption performance with the
   reflection loss (RL) of -50.20 dB at a thin thickness of 1.6 mm. This
   work highlights the effect of metal compositions on the electromagnetic
   wave absorption performance and provides an environmentally friendly,
   low cost and easy-to-large-scale-preparation approach for the design of
   metal alloy/CF electromagnetic wave absorbers. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {A Silica-Aerogel-Reinforced Composite Polymer Electrolyte with High
   Ionic Conductivity and High Modulus},
Journal = {ADVANCED MATERIALS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {30},
Number = {32},
Month = {AUG 9},
Abstract = {High-energy all-solid-state lithium (Li) batteries have great potential
   as next-generation energy-storage devices. Among all choices of
   electrolytes, polymer-based systems have attracted widespread attention
   due to their low density, low cost, and excellent processability.
   However, they are generally mechanically too weak to effectively
   suppress Li dendrites and have lower ionic conductivity for reasonable
   kinetics at ambient temperature. Herein, an ultrastrong reinforced
   composite polymer electrolyte (CPE) is successfully designed and
   fabricated by introducing a stiff mesoporous SiO2 aerogel as the
   backbone for a polymer-based electrolyte. The interconnected SiO2
   aerogel not only performs as a strong backbone strengthening the whole
   composite, but also offers large and continuous surfaces for strong
   anion adsorption, which produces a highly conductive pathway across the
   composite. As a consequence, a high modulus of approximate to 0.43 GPa
   and high ionic conductivity of approximate to 0.6 mS cm(-1) at 30
   degrees C are simultaneously achieved. Furthermore, LiFePO4-Li full
   cells with good cyclability and rate capability at ambient temperature
   are obtained. Full cells with cathode capacity up to 2.1 mAh cm(-2) are
   also demonstrated. The aerogel-reinforced CPE represents a new design
   principle for solid-state electrolytes and offers opportunities for
   future all-solid-state Li batteries.},

   presence of this hybrid. Strong interfacial interactions between the
   functionalized MoSe2 sheets and TPU can be obtained, making more
   efficient load transfer from the weak polymer chains to the robust
   sheets. Besides, more coherent barrier network may be formed in polymer
   matrix, restraining the diffusion of decomposed fragments and reducing
   the supply for combustion fuel. Consequently, the decreases in heat
   release are observed for polymer composites. Notably, the releases of
   toxic gases, such as HCN and CO, are also suppressed by this barrier
   network, resulting in the reductions in fire toxicity. This work may

Abstract = {Booming progress in the materials science offers a huge choice of novel
   porous solids which may be used for adsorption transformation of low
   temperature heat. This communication gives an overview of original and
   literature data on several classes of materials potentially promising
   for this important application, namely, metalaluminophosphates (AlPOs,
   SAPOs, MeAPOs), metal-organic frameworks (MIL ISE, etc.), ordered porous
   solids (MCM, SBA, etc.), porous carbons and various composites (SWSs,
   AlPO-Al foil). For the SWS composites, we briefly considered the recent
   trends in their developing, namely, usage of host matrices with uniform
   pore dimensions and binary salt systems. We hope that this review will
   give new impulses to target-oriented research on the novel adsorbents
   for AHT and may also be beneficial for further consolidating
   international activities in materials science and heat transformation
   applications. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   their excellent shielding performance, outstanding metallic
   conductivity, low density, large specific surface area, tunable surface
   chemistry, and solution processability. MXenes triggered a huge interest
   in the materials research community, leading to over 100 reported
   publications on MXenes' EMI shielding within 3 years. Many MXenes
   composites and hybrids in different structural forms, such as compact
   and laminate structures, layer-by-layer assemblies, porous foams and
   aerogels, and segregated structures, have been explored to further
   improve the intrinsic EMI shielding properties of MXenes. This article

Abstract = {Nanocasting was used to develop epoxy/graphene composites (EGCs) as
   corrosion inhibitors with hydrophobic surfaces (HEGC). The contact angle
   of water droplets on a sample surface can be increased from -82 (epoxy
   surface) to -127 (hydrophobic epoxy and EGC). It should be noted that
   EGC coating was found to provide an excellent corrosion protection
   effect on cold-rolled steel (CRS) electrode. Enhancement of corrosion
   protection using EGC coatings could be attributed to the following three
   reasons: (1) epoxy could act as a physical barrier coating, (2) the
   hydrophobicity repelled the moisture and further reduced the
   water/corrosive media adsorption on the epoxy surface, preventing the
   underlying metals from corrosion attack, and (3) the well-dispersed
   graphene nanosheets (GNSs) embedded in HEGC matrix could prevent
   corrosion owing to a relatively higher aspect ratio than clay platelets,
   which enhances the oxygen barrier property of HEGC. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {Fast ion conduction in solid-state matrices constitutes the foundation
   for a wide spectrum of electrochemical systems that use solid
   electrolytes (SEs), examples of which include solid-state batteries
   (SSBs), solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs), and diversified gas sensors.
   Mixing different solid conductors to form composite solid electrolytes
   (CSEs) introduces unique opportunities for SEs to possess exceptional
   overall performance far superior to their individual parental solids,
   thanks to the abundant chemistry and physics at the new interfaces thus
   created. In this review, we provide a comprehensive and in-depth
   examination of the development and understanding of CSEs for SSBs, with
   special focus on their physiochemical properties and mechanisms of ion
   transport therein. The origin of the enhanced ionic conductivity in CSEs
   relative to their single-phase parents is discussed in the context of
   defect chemistry and interfacial reactions. The models/theories for ion
   movement in diversified composites are critically reviewed to
   interrogate a general strategy to the design of novel CSEs, while
   properties such as mechanical strength and electrochemical stability are
   discussed in view of their perspective applications in lithium metal
   batteries and beyond. As an integral component of understanding how ions
   interact with their composite environments, characterization techniques
   to probe the ion transport kinetics across different temporal and
   spatial time scales are also summarized.},

Abstract = {Co3O4 imbedded g-C3N4 (Co3O4/g-C3N4) heterojunction photocatalysts were
   synthesized via initial dissolution of C, N and Co organic precursors in
   aqueous phase, subsequent evaporation of water and final
   thermopolymerization. This facile aqueous-induced complexation of
   organic precursors guaranteed that Co3O4 was homogeneously dispersed in
   g-C3N4 matrix even if the mass loading of Co3O4 reached up to 0.3-3 wt
   \%. The as-constructed Co3O4/g-C3N4 composites were applied in
   visible-light-driven hydrogen evolution for the first time in which the
   mass loading of Co3O4 was optimized at 1 wt \%, achieving a maximal
   hydrogen evolution rate of 50 mu mol/h/g, as higher as 5 times than
   those of pure g-C3N4 and Co3O4. The enhanced photocatalytic activity of
   Co3O4/g-C3N4 composites was originated from well-established p-n
   heterojunctions when certain amount of p-type Co3O4 nanoparticles were
   introduced and highly dispersed into n-type g-C3N4 matrix. The
   Co3O4/g-C3N4 p-n heterojunctions effectively retard the recombination of
   photoinduced electron-hole pairs, promote charge separation, extend
   visible light absorption range and finally improve photocatalytic
   hydrogen evolution activity and stability. As a result, this facile,
   effective, green and universal strategy opens up new horizons to realize
   high dispersion of metal oxides in g-C3N4 matrix and to achieve higher
   performance in photocatalytic activity. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All

  abstract                   = {Until now there has been no fundamental theory applicable for
   biodegradable metals (BMs). First, this paper optimizes the definition
   of BMs given in 2014. Second, the dual criteria of biodegradability and
   biocompatibility are proposed for BMs, and all metallic elements in the
   periodic table with accessible data are screened on the basis of these
   criteria. Regarding biodegradability, electrode potential, reactivity
   series, galvanic series, Pilling-Bedworth ratio, and Pourbaix diagrams
   are all adopted as parameters to classify the degradable and
   nondegradable nature of a material, especially in a physiological
   environment. Considering the biocompatibility at different levels,
   cellular biocompatibility, tissue biocompatibility, and human/clinical
   related biocompatibility parameters are put forward to comprehensively
   evaluate the biosafety of BMs. Third, for the material design of BMs,
   mechanical properties, chemical properties, physical properties and
   biological properties should be considered and balanced to guarantee
   that the degradation behavior of BMs match well with a tissue
   regeneration/repair procedure as the function of time and spatial
   location. Besides the selected metallic elements, some nonmetallic
   elements are selected as suitable alloying elements for BMs. Finally,
   five classification/research directions for future BMs are proposed:
   biodegradable pure metals, crystalline alloys, bulk metallic glasses,
   high entropy alloys, and metal matrix composites.},

   combined properties that belongs to alloys and metals according to
   market demands. This makes composites completely different and paves the
   way for new applications that requires the utmost properties. Machining
   of such composites is of great importance to finalize the fabrication
   process with improved part quality; however, the process implies several
   challenges due to the complexity of the cutting processes and random
   material structure. The current study aims to examine the machinability
   characteristics when milling novel material, Cu-B-CrC composites using
   Al/TiN coated carbide tools. Further, the influence of machining
   parameters along with the different weight ratios of the powders amounts
   used to fabricate the machined reinforced samples on output parameters
   namely surface roughness, tool wear, chip morphology and cutting
   temperatures was investigated. One of the key findings of the study is
   the dominant effect of reinforcement ratio (Cu, B, CrC) on
   machinability, which showed that 5\% additive (2\% B, 3\% CrC) provides
   improved properties such as surface roughness, tool wear and cutting
   temperature. Cutting speed alterations play an important role in the
   machinability characteristics, i.e., increasing value increases flank
   wear and cutting temperatures and reduces surface roughness. Increasing
   feed rate in-creases the surface roughness meanwhile its effect shows
   changing behavior on the flank wear and cutting temperatures according
   to cutting speed and reinforcement ratio.(c) 2021 The Authors. Published

Abstract = {Introduction: Nano-SiC has attracted great attention as ceramic
   reinforcement in metal matrix composites, but the weak interface bonding
   between them remains a bottleneck for efficient strengthening.
   Objective: In this study, pre-oxidation treatments and selective laser
   melting (SLM) were employed to prepare Zn/nano-SiC biocomposites with
   strengthened interface bonding via in situ reaction.
   Methods: Nano-SiC and Zn powders were pre-oxidized respectively, and
   then used to prepare Zn/nanoSiC biocomposites via SLM. The powder
   microstructure, and the interface characteristics and mechanical
   properties of the biocomposites were investigated. The degradation
   properties and cell response were analyzed to evaluate their feasibility
   for orthopedic applications.
   Results: The results indicated that the pre-oxidation treatments
   generated a uniform oxide layer on the surface of both nano-SiC and Zn
   particles and the thickness of the oxide layer increased with
   pre-oxidation temperature. During the SLM process, the oxide layers not
   only improved the metal-ceramic wettability by reducing interface
   energy, but also induced in situ reaction to form chemical bonding
   between the Zn matrix and nano-SiC, thereby improving the interface
   bonding. Consequently, the Zn biocomposite reinforced by nano-SiC with a
   pre-oxidation temperature of 1000 degrees C (ZS1000 biocomposite)
   exhibited more transgranular fracture and significantly enhanced
   compressive yield strength of 171.5 MPa, which was 31.6\% higher than
   that of the Zn biocomposite reinforced by nano-SiC without
   pre-oxidation. Moreover, the ZS1000 biocomposite presented slightly
   accelerated degradation which might be ascribed to the facilitated
   electron transfer by the interface product (Zn2SiO4). In addition, the
   ZS1000 biocomposite also showed appropriate biocompatibility for MG-63
   cell adhesion, growth, and proliferation.
   Conclusion: This study shows the potential practical applicability for
   the preparation of Zn-based biocomposites with strong interface bonding
   and mechanical properties for orthopedic applications. (C) 2022 The

   high energy density lithium batteries. Herein, we develop a
   three-dimensional (3D) hybrid host consisting of Ag
   nanoparticle-embedded nitrogen-doped carbon macroporous fibers (denoted
   as Ag@CMFs) with selective nucleation and targeted deposition of Li. The
   3D macroporous framework can inhibit the formation of dendritic Li by
   capturing metallic Li in the matrix as well as reducing local current
   density, the lithiophilic nitrogen-doped carbons act as homogeneous
   nucleation sites owing to the small nucleation barrier, and the Ag
   nanoparticles improve the Li nucleation and growth behavior with the
   reversible solid solution-based alloying reaction. As a result, the
   Ag@CMF composite enables a dendrite-free Li plating/stripping behavior
   with high Coulombic efficiency for more than 500 cycles. When this anode
   is coupled with a commercial LiFePO4 cathode, the assembled full cell
   manifests high rate capability and stable cycling life.},

   owing to their superior physicochemical properties over polymers.
   However, the tendency of graphene sheets to aggregate makes it difficult
   to achieve homogenous dispersion in polymer matrix. Herein, by
   utilization of poly(2-butylaniline) (P2BA) as a dispersing agent, stable
   dispersion of graphene in organic solvents was achieved via non-covalent
   pi-pi interactions between P2BA and graphene nanosheets. The exfoliated
   graphene nanosheets were then integrated with coating matrix by curing
   reaction of epoxy resin with P2BA functionalized graphene (P2BA-G) and
   amine hardener. Embedding a small percentage of well-dispersed graphene
   nanosheets (P2BA(0.5\%)-G(0.5\%)) in epoxy coating remarkably improved
   anticorrosion performance and wear resistance properties, which was
   attributed to the synergistic effects of the redox catalytic capability
   of P2BA, high mechanical and barrier properties of well-dispersed
   graphene nanosheets in the epoxy matrix. The present study provides a
   promise strategy for development of graphene reinforced organic coatings
   with superior physical-mechanical properties for metal protection. (C)

Abstract = {MXenes are emerging rapidly as a new family of multifunctional
   nanomaterials with prospective applications rivaling that of graphenes.
   Herein, a timely account of the design and performance evaluation of
   MXene-based membranes is provided. First, the preparation and
   physicochemical characteristics of MXenes are outlined, with a focus on
   exfoliation, dispersion stability, and processability, which are crucial
   factors for membrane fabrication. Then, different formats of MXene-based
   membranes in the literature are introduced, comprising pristine or
   intercalated nanolaminates and polymer-based nanocomposites. Next, the
   major membrane processes so far pursued by MXenes are evaluated,
   covering gas separation, wastewater treatment, desalination, and organic
   solvent purification. The potential utility of MXenes in phase inversion
   and interfacial polymerization, as well as layer-by-layer assembly for
   the preparation of nanocomposite membranes, is also critically
   discussed. Looking forward, exploiting the high electrical conductivity
   and catalytic activity of certain MXenes is put into perspective for
   niche applications that are not easily achievable by other
   nanomaterials. Furthermore, the benefits of simulation/modeling
   approaches for designing MXene-based membranes are exemplified. Overall,
   critical insights are provided for materials science and membrane
   communities to navigate better while exploring the potential of MXenes
   for developing advanced separation membranes.},

   The model developed is a modification of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
   using dwarf mongoose optimization (DMO), which mimics the behavior of
   DMO to find its food for predicting the behavior of the composite. The
   swarm of DMO consists of three groups, namely the alpha group, scouts,
   and babysitters. Each group has its own behavior to capture the food.
   The preparation of the nanocomposite was performed using aluminum
   nitrate that was added to a solution containing scattered copper
   nitrate. After that, the powders of CuO and Al2O3 were obtained, and the
   leftover liquid was removed using thermal treatment at 850 degrees C for
   1 h. The powders were consolidated using compaction and sintering
   processes. The impact of Al2O3 contents on the thermal properties of the
   Cu-Al2O3 nanocomposite was investigated. The results showed that the
   Thermal Expansion Coefficient (TEC) decreases with increasing Al2O3
   content due to the increased precipitation of Al2O3 nanoparticles at the
   grain boundaries of the Cu matrix. Moreover, the good interfacial
   bonding between Al2O3 and the Cu may participate in this decrease in
   TEC. The proposed machine learning model was able to predict the TEC of
   all the produced composites with different Al2O3 content and was tested
   at different temperatures with very good accuracy, reaching 99\%.},

Abstract = {Fe-based magnetic nanoparticles (NPs) embedded into mesoporous carbon
   hybrid (Fe@MesoC) was successfully fabricated from Fe-based
   metal-organic framework (MIL-100(Fe)) through a pyrolysis method, which
   was for the first time proposed as a novel Fenton-like catalyst for the
   degradation of sulfamethoxazole (SMX). The catalytic activity of
   Fe@MesoC was systematically evaluated on the basis of several reaction
   parameters including initial pH, initial H2O2 concentration and
   temperature. Under the optimal conditions, the Fe@MesoC composite
   demonstrated a superior catalytic activity for decomposing SMX in the
   presence of H2O2, and it accomplished 100\% SMX and 54.5\% total organic
   carbon (TOC) conversion within 120 min. Such outstanding performance can
   be explained by the excellent enrichment ability of the outer mesoporous
   carbon matrix, the abundant active sites of the inner Fe-based NPs, as
   well as the possible synergistic effect between the two components.
   Moreover, the facile electrons transfer from Fe-0 to iron oxide in the
   inner Fe-based NPs could facilitate the reduction of Fe3+ to  Fe2+ (
   represents the iron species anchored to the surface of the catalyst) and
   further improve the generation of hydroxyl radicals. With the high
   structural stability and saturation magnetization, the Fe@MesoC
   composite can be easily recycled for three subsequent runs without
   significant activity loss. The possible catalytic mechanism and
   degradation pathways for SMX degradation induced by hydroxyl radicals in
   Fe@MesoC/H2O2 Fenton-like system were also tentatively proposed.},

Abstract = {The main purpose of research in membrane gas separation is to develop
   membranes with high permeability and selectivity. Historically, the gas
   separation performance of polymeric membranes has been constrained to an
   upper performance limit. Hence, different methods have been investigated
   to prepare membranes that can exceed this limitation including the
   incorporation of inorganic materials into polymer matrices. Membranes
   formed by this method are called mixed matrix membranes (MMMs). The
   major challenge is to prepare a defect-free polymer/inorganic
   nanoparticles interfaces with enhanced separation performance and
   mechanical and thermal stability. For this purpose, various types of
   nanoparticles have been proposed and examined experimentally. This
   review is especially devoted to summarize the fundamental concepts that
   have to be considered to prepare various types of MMMs, including
   considerations for the design novel MMMs that will eventually surpass
   the Robeson's trade-off upper bound. In addition, it provides the pros
   and cons of various factors that affect the MMM preparation especially
   for CO2 separation processes. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   cells with therapeutic or facilitating regeneration effect. The paper
   briefly focuses on divers 3D bioprinting constructs and the challenges
   they face. Based on their application in hard and soft tissue
   engineering, in vitro and in vivo effects triggered by the structural
   and biological functionalized biomaterials are underlined. The authors
   discuss the future outlook for the development of bioactive scaffolds

  abstract                   = {The recent development of nanoscale fillers, such as carbon nanotubes,
   graphene, and nanocellulose, allows the functionality of polymer
   nanocomposites to be controlled and enhanced. However, conventional
   synthesis methods of polymer nanocomposites cannot maximise the
   reinforcement of these nanofillers at high filler content. Approaches
   for the synthesis of high content filler polymer nanocomposites are
   suggested to facilitate future applications. The fabrication methods
   address the design of the polymer nanocomposite architecture, which
   encompasses one, two, and three dimensional morphologies. Factors that
   hamper the reinforcement of nanostructures, such as alignment,
   dispersion of the filler and interfacial bonding between the filler and
   polymer, are outlined. Using suitable approaches, maximum potential
   reinforcement of nanoscale fillers can be anticipated without
   limitations in orientation, dispersion, and the integrity of the filler
   particle-matrix interface. High filler content polymer composites
   containing emerging materials such as 2D transition metal carbides,
   nitrides, and carbonitrides (MXenes) are expected in the future.},

Title = {Recent development of magnetic biochar crosslinked chitosan on heavy
   metal removal from wastewater-Modification, application and mechanism},
Journal = {CHEMOSPHERE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {291},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Heavy metal contamination in water bodies is currently in an area of
   greater concern due to the adverse effects on human health. Despite the
   good adsorption performance of biochar, various modifications have been
   performed on the pristine biochar to further enhance its adsorption
   capability, at the same time overcome the difficulty of particles
   separation and mitigate the secondary pollution issues. In this review,
   the feasibility of chitosan-modified magnetic biochar for heavy metal
   removal from aqueous solution is evaluated by critically analysing
   existing research. The effective strategies that applied to introduce
   chitosan and magnetic substances into the biochar matrix are
   systematically reviewed. The physicochemical changes of the
   modified-biochar composite are expounded in terms of surface morphology,
   pore properties, specific surface area, surface functional groups and
   electromagnetism. The detailed information regarding the adsorption
   performances of various modified biochar towards different heavy metals
   and their respective underlying mechanisms are studied indepth. The
   current review also analyses the kinetic and isotherm models that
   dominated the adsorption process and summarizes the common models that
   fitted well to most of the experimental adsorption data. Moreover, the
   operating parameters that affect the adsorption process which include
   solution pH, temperature, initial metal concentration, adsorbent dosage,
   contact time and the effect of interfering ions are explored. This
   review also outlines the stability of modified biochar and their
   regeneration rate after cycles of heavy metal removal process. Lastly,
   constructive suggestions on the future trends and directions are
   provided for better research and development of chitosan-modified
   magnetic biochar.},

   Li metal anode and LiFePO4 cathode exhibits an initial reversible
   discharge capacity of 120 mA h g(-1) at a charge/discharge current
   density of 0.5 C at room temperature. This solid-state battery is used
   to store the energy harvested by a TENG at different rotation rates. The

  abstract                   = {The photocatalytic degradation of methylparaben was investigated under
   simulated solar light using a synthesised metal-organic framework
   (UiO-66-NH2). For that purpose, the pollutant was spiked in different
   water matrices: distilled water, water from Lima River (Northwestern
   Portugal), and urban wastewater. Complete removal of the methylparaben
   in distilled water was achieved in 1 h reaction. In natural water
   matrices, the photocatalytic performance decreased to 70\% removal after
   3 h reaction, owing to the physical-chemical properties of the water
   samples. The UiO-66-NH2 photocatalyst revealed high stability under the
   continuous mode, reaching a steady state in 5 h, from which the removal
   percentage was kept constant for 25 h. The photocatalytic degradation of
   methylparaben gave five main reaction byproducts and four short-chain
   carboxylic acids, identified by LC/ESI-MS and UHPLC analyses,
   respectively. The mechanism of degradation was investigated by using
   selective scavengers. Photogenerated holes and superoxide radicals were
   found as the main species responsible for the degradation of
   methylparaben. The abatement of other parabens (as ethyl-and
   propylparaben) was also evaluated, being the conversion influenced by
   the length of the alkyl side chain. The results of this study give a
   comprehensive sight into the effective photocatalytic remediation of
   parabens using UiO-66-NH2.},

Abstract = {The rechargeable lithium-sulfur battery is regarded as a promising
   option for electrochemical energy storage systems owing to its high
   energy density, low cost and environmental friendliness. Further
   development of the Li-S battery, however, is still impeded by capacity
   decay and kinetic sluggishness caused by the polysulfide shuttle and
   electrode/electrolyte interface issues. Herein, a new type of
   metal-organic-framework-derived sulfur host containing cobalt and
   N-doped graphitic carbon (Co-N-GC) was synthesized and reported, in
   which the catalyzing for S redox, entrapping of polysulfides and an
   ideal electronic matrix were successfully achieved synchronously,
   leading to a significant improvement in the Li-S performance. The large
   surface area and uniform dispersion of cobalt nanoparticles within the
   N-doped graphitic carbon matrix contributed to a distinct enhancement in
   the specific capacity, rate performance and cycle stability for Li-S
   batteries. As a result of this multi-functional arrangement, cathodes
   with a high sulfur loading of 70 wt\% could operate at 1C for over 500
   cycles with nearly 100\% coulombic efficiency and exhibited an
   outstanding high-rate response of up to 5C, suggesting that the
   S@Co-N-GC electrode was markedly improved by the proposed strategy,
   demonstrating its great potential for use in low-cost and high-energy
   Li-S batteries.},

   to human adults due to the consumption of such vegetables in Jhansi. The
   total amounts of zinc (Zn), lead (Pb), nickel (Ni), manganese (Mn),
   copper (Cu), cobalt (Co), and cadmium (Cd) were analysed in 28 composite
   samples of soil and vegetables (Fenugreek, spinach, eggplant, and
   chilli) collected from seven agricultural fields. The transfer factor
   (TF) of HMs from soil to analysed vegetables was calculated, and
   significant non-carcinogenic health risks due to exposure to analysed
   heavy metals via consumption of these vegetables were computed. The
   statistical analysis involving Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and
   Pearson's correlation matrix suggested that anthropogenic activities
   were a major source of HMs in the study areas. The target hazard
   quotient of Cd, Mn, and Pb for fenugreek (2.156, 2.143, and 2.228,
   respectively) and spinach (3.697, 3.509, 5.539, respectively) exceeded
   the unity, indicating the high possibilities of non-carcinogenic health
   risks if regularly consumed by human beings. This study strongly
   suggests the continuous monitoring of soil, irrigation water, and
   vegetables to prohibit excessive accumulation in the food chain.},

   Composites for Catalysis: Recent Progress and Perspectives},
Journal = {ADVANCED MATERIALS},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Beyond conventional porous materials, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs)
   have aroused great interest in the construction of nanocatalysts with
   the characteristics of catalytically active nanoparticles (NPs) confined
   into the cavities/channels of MOFs or surrounded by MOFs. The advantages
   of adopting MOFs as the encapsulating matrix are multifold: uniform and
   long-range ordered cavities can effectively promote the mass transfer
   and diffusion of substrates and products, while the diverse metal nodes
   and tunable organic linkers may enable outstanding synergy functions
   with the encapsulated active NPs. Herein, some key issues related to
   MOFs for catalysis are discussed. Then, state-of-the art progress in the
   encapsulation of catalytically active NPs by MOFs as well as their
   synergy functions for enhanced catalytic performance in the fields of
   thermo-, photo-, and electrocatalysis are summarized. Notably,
   encapsulation-structured nanocatalysts exhibit distinct advantages over
   conventional supported catalysts, especially in terms of the catalytic
   selectivity and stability. Finally, challenges and future developments
   in MOF-based encapsulation-structured nanocatalysts are proposed. The
   aim is to deliver better insight into the design of well-defined
   nanocatalysts with atomically accurate structures and high performance
   in challenging reactions.},

   issue due to its hazardous chemical nature. Fabrication of hybrid
   mixed-matrix is a typical and powerful approach to create new
   functionalities that cannot be represented by single-phase materials. In
   present study, we have reported the in-situ growth of zeolite
   imidazolate frameworks (ZIF-67) on layered double hydroxides (LDH) to
   form porous composites to develop materials for removal of methylene
   blue (MB) and methyl orange (MO). Scanning electron spectroscopy showed
   a sandwich like structure of composite decorated with polyhedrons of
   ZIF-67. For comparative studies, ZIF-67 and CoAl-LDH were also
   synthesized and used for adsorptive removal of MB and MO dyes. Results
   showed that ZIF-67@CoAl-LDH has good adsorption capacity (q(m), 57.24 mg
   g(-1)) for methylene blue as compared to LDH (15.04 mg g(-1)) and ZIF-67
   (57.14 mg g(-1)). Furthermore, ZIF-67@CoAl-LDH also showed good
   adsorption capacity (qm 180.5 mg g(-1)) for methyl orange than LDH
   (32.27 mg g(-1)) and ZIF-67 (75.58 mg g(-1)). Also, with 100 min contact
   time 79.9\% MB and with 90 min contact time 72.3\% MO was adsorbed by
   ZIF-67 and it's composite. The equilibrium adsorption data were well
   fitted by Langmuir model and relatively high correlation coefficient of
   Langmuir model (R-2 = 0.9953 ZIF-67 and 0.9889 ZIF-67@CoAl-LDH) for MB
   and (R-2 = 0.9917 ZIF-67 and 0.9737 ZIF-67@CoAl-LDH) for MO suggesting a
   mono-layer adsorption of MB and MO on the ZIF-67 and its composite.
   Further, the ZIF-67 and its composite (ZIF-67@CoAl-LDH) exhibited no
   obvious loss in MB and MO removal after recycling for four times. The
   overall results indicate that the as-prepared ZIF-67 and its composite
   are efficient for removal of dye pollutants containing methylene blue
   and methyl orange form water.},

Title = {Metal-organic frameworks in mixed-matrix membranes for gas separation},
Journal = {DALTON TRANSACTIONS},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {41},
Number = {46},
Pages = {14003-14027},
Abstract = {Mixed-matrix membranes (MMMs) with metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) as
   additives (fillers) exhibit enhanced gas permeabilities and possibly
   also selectivities when compared to the pure polymer. Polyimides
   (Matrimid (R)) and polysulfones are popular polymer matrices for MOF
   fillers. Presently investigated MOFs for MMMs include
   {[}Cu(SiF6)(4,4'-BIPY)(2)], {[}Cu-3(BTC)(2)(H2O)(3)] (HKUST-1, Cu-BTC),
   {[}Cu(BDC)(DMF)], {[}Zn4O(BDC)(3)] (MOF-5),
   {[}Zn(2-methylimidazolate)(2)] (ZIF-8), {[}Zn(purinate)(2)] (ZIF-20),
   {[}Zn(2-carboxyaldehyde imidazolate)(2)] (ZIF-90), Mn(HCOO)(2),
   {[}Al(BDC)(mu-OH)] (MIL-53(Al)), {[}Al(NH2-BDC)(mu-OH)] (NH2-MIL-53(Al))
   and {[}Cr3O(BDC)(3)(F,OH)(H2O)(2)] (MIL-101) (4,4'-BIPY =
   4,4'-bipyridine, BTC = benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxylate, BDC =
   benzene-1,4-dicarboxylate, terephthalate). MOF particle adhesion to
   polyimide and polysulfone organic polymers does not represent a problem.
   MOF-polymer MMMs are investigated for the permeability of the single
   gases H-2, N-2, O-2, CH4, CO2 and of the gas mixtures O-2/N-2, H-2/CH4,
   CO2/CH4, H-2/CO2, CH4/N-2 and CO2/N-2 (preferentially permeating gas
   named first). Permeability increases can be traced to the MOF porosity.
   Since the porosity of MOFs can be tuned very precisely, which is not
   possible with polymeric material, MMMs offer the opportunity of
   significantly increasing the selectivity compared to the pure polymeric
   matrix. Additionally in most of the cases the permeability is increased
   for MMM membranes compared to the pure polymer. Addition of MOFs to
   polymers in MMMs easily yields performances similar to the best polymer
   membranes and gives higher selectivities than those reported to date for
   any pure MOF membrane for the same gas separation. MOF-polymer MMMs
   allow for easier synthesis and handability compared to pure MOF
   membranes.},

Abstract = {Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) represent a fascinating class of solid
   crystalline materials which can be self-assembled in a straightforward
   manner by the coordination of metal ions or clusters with organic
   ligands. Owing to their intrinsic porous characteristics, unique
   chemical versatility and abundant functionalities, MOFs have received
   substantial attention for diverse industrial applications, including
   membrane separation. Exciting research activities ranging from
   fabrication strategies to separation applications of MOF-based membranes
   have appeared. Inspired by the marvelous achievements of MOF-based
   membranes in gas separations, liquid separations are also being explored
   for the purpose of constructing continuous MOFs membranes or MOF-based
   mixed matrix membranes. Although these are in an emerging stage of
   vigorous development, most efforts are directed towards improving the
   liquid separation efficiency with well-designed MOF-based membranes.
   Therefore, as an increasing trend in membrane separation, the field of
   MOF-based membranes for liquid separation is highlighted in this review.
   The criteria for judicious selection of MOFs in fabricating MOF-based
   membranes are given. Special attention is paid to rational design
   strategies for MOF-based membranes, along with the latest application
   progress in the area of liquid separations, such as pervaporation, water
   treatment, and organic solvent nanofiltration. Moreover, some attractive
   dual-function applications of MOF-based membranes in the removal of
   micropollutants, degradation, and antibacterial activity are also
   reviewed. Finally, we define the remaining challenges and future
   opportunities in this field. This Tutorial Review provides an overview
   and outlook for MOF-based membranes for liquid separations. Further
   development of MOF-based membranes for liquid separation must consider
   the demands of strict separation standards and environmental safety for
   industrial application.},

Title = {Highly Conductive Transition Metal
   Carbide/Carbonitride(MXene)@polystyrene Nanocomposites Fabricated by
   Electrostatic Assembly for Highly Efficient Electromagnetic Interference
   Shielding},

Abstract = {Highly conductive polymer nanocomposites are greatly desired for
   electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding applications. Although
   transition metal carbide/carbonitride (MXene) has shown its huge
   potential for producing highly conductive films and bulk materials, it
   still remains a great challenge to fabricate extremely conductive
   polymer nanocomposites with outstanding EMI shielding performance at
   minimal amounts of MXenes. Herein, an electrostatic assembly approach
   for fabricating highly conductive MXene@polystyrene nanocomposites by
   electrostatic assembling of negative MXene nanosheets on positive
   polystyrene microspheres is demonstrated, followed by compression
   molding. Thanks to the high conductivity of MXenes and their highly
   efficient conducting network within polystyrene matrix, the resultant
   nanocomposites exhibit not only a low percolation threshold of 0.26
   vol\% but also a superb conductivity of 1081 S m(-1) and an outstanding
   EMI shielding performance of >54 dB over the whole X-band with a maximum
   of 62 dB at the low MXene loading of 1.90 vol\%, which are among the
   best performances for electrically conductive polymer nanocomposites by
   far. Moreover, the same nanocomposite has a highly enhanced storage
   modulus, 54\% and 56\% higher than those of neat polystyrene and
   conventional MXene@polystyrene nanocomposite, respectively. This work
   provides a novel methodology to produce highly conductive polymer
   nanocomposites for highly efficient EMI shielding applications.},

Title = {A hierarchical Co @ mesoporous C/macroporous C sheet composite derived

   absorption},
Journal = {CARBON},

Abstract = {Recently, biomass-derived carbon absorbing materials have received
   extensive attention due to their diverse structures, wide sources and
   low cost. However, it is still a great challenge to construct
   high-efficiency biomass-based absorbers with hierarchical and
   multi-component micro-nanoarchitecture. To this end, a novel Co @
   mesoporous C/macroporous C sheet hybrid was successfully prepared by
   in-situ self-assembly of ZnCo MOF nanosheet arrays on biomass-derived
   porous carbon sheets via hydrothermal and pyrolysis methods. By tuning
   the molar ratio of Zn2+ to Co2+ ions, the optimal RLmin value was up to
   -66.9 dB and a wide EAB of 5.6 GHz was simultaneously obtained at the
   filler loading of 12 wt\%. The results showed that this unique 3D
   micro-nanostructure possessed larger specific surface area, rich
   heterogeneous interfaces, massive defects and multi-level porosity,
   which was favorable for multiple reflection and scattering, dielectric
   loss, magnetic loss, as well as impedance matching. As a consequence,
   the as-prepared composites displayed significantly enhanced microwave
   absorption performance than the pristine biomass carbon. In this regard,
   the integration of MOF monomer and biomass matrix is expected to provide
   new guidance for the design of hierarchical multi-scale porous
   heterostructures as lightweight and enhanced microwave absorbing
   materials. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Synthetic polymer membranes can potentially reduce the large energy and
   carbon footprints that are typically associated with traditional
   chemical separation technologies. Unfortunately, current production
   protocols negate the green benefits of membrane separation. To address
   this bottleneck, here we report the use of natural materials
   monosaccharide - glucose and polydopamine and Zr-based metal organic
   frameworks (MOFs) to fabricate ultrathin nanocomposite membranes via
   interfacial polymerization reaction. The synergistic effect of these
   three materials on angstrom-scale molecular transport both in organic
   solvent and aqueous environment was elucidated using a series of
   complementary techniques. We demonstrate such nature-inspired
   nanocomposite membranes enable structural stability even in polar
   aprotic solvents, and unparalleled ultra-fast, low-pressure, precise
   separations in both nanofiltration modes, which easily surpass
   state-of-the-art membranes relying on unsustainable materials. The
   multi-functionality of saccharide nanocomposites was elegantly harnessed
   to impact separation applications that contribute towards a better

Abstract = {Two-dimensional (2D) metal-organic framework (MOF) nanosheets are
   attracting increasing research attention due to their unique properties
   originating from their ultrathin thickness, large surface area and high
   surface-to-volume atom ratios. Many great advances have been made in the
   synthesis and application of 2D MOF nanosheets over the past few years.
   In this review, we summarize the recent advances in the synthesis of 2D
   MOF nanosheets by using top-down methods, e.g. sonication exfoliation,
   mechanical exfoliation, Li-intercalation exfoliation and chemical
   exfoliation, and bottom-up methods, i.e. interfacial synthesis,
   three-layer synthesis, surfactant-assisted synthesis, modulated
   synthesis, and sonication synthesis. In addition, the recent progress in
   2D MOF nanosheet-based nanocomposites is also briefly introduced. The
   potential applications of 2D MOF nanosheets in gas separation, energy
   conversion and storage, catalysis, sensors and biomedicine are
   discussed. Finally, we give our personal insights into the challenges
   and opportunities for the future research of 2D MOF nanosheets and their

Abstract = {Nanocomposites are now commonly employed to augment the standard
   polymeric membrane materials that are used in water treatment processes.
   A number of different materials and methods have been put forward;
   amongst those that show the greatest promise so far are thin-film
   nanocomposite (TFN), electrospun polymeric nanofibrous membranes, carbon
   nanotubes, metal and metal oxides, graphene and graphene oxide, and
   zwitterionic materials. This paper presents a detailed review of the
   current developments in the use of polymeric nanocomposite membranes for
   purifying water. Various nanocomposite membranes have been reported to
   evaluate their effectiveness in terms of resistance to fouling and the
   performance of the membranes. A specific focus has been placed on better
   understanding how nanomaterials can be used in a number of different
   ways, such as nanofiltration, micro-filtration, reverse osmosis and
   membrane distillation. This review aims to offer inspiration for further
   progress in the field of water treatment and desalination employing
   polymeric nanocomposite membranes. (C) 2019 The Korean Society of

Abstract = {Environmental challenges especially air pollution (particulate matter
   (PM) and toxic gases) pose serious threats to public health globally.
   Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are crystalline materials with high
   porosity, tunable pore size, and rich functionalities, holding the
   promise for poisonous pollutants capture. Here, nanocrystals of four
   unique MOF structures are processed into nanofibrous filters (noted as
   MOFilter) with high MOF loadings (up to 60 wt \%). The MOFilters show
   high PM removal efficiencies up to 88.33 +/- 1.52\% and 89.67 +/- 1.33\%
   for PM2.5 and PM10, respectively, in the hazy environment, and the
   performance remains largely unchanged over 48 h of continuous
   filtration. For the first time,, the interactions between such porous
   crystalline material and particulate pollutants were explored. These
   thin MOFilters can further selectively capture and retain SO2 when
   exposed to a stream of SO2/N-2 mixture, and their-hierarchical
   nanostructures can easily permeate fresh air at high gas flow rate with
   the pressure drop <20 Pa.},

Title = {Recent progress on fabrication methods of polymeric thin film gas
   separation membranes for CO2 capture},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MEMBRANE SCIENCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {572},
Pages = {38-60},
Month = {JAN 15},
Abstract = {Membrane technology has been recognized as an attractive and
   environment-friendly technology for carbon capture due to its low
   expense (capital and operating), ease of operation as well as low energy
   consumption. Traditionally, the membrane materials are cast into dense
   membranes with a thickness of 50-150 mu m and their gas separation
   properties are evaluated by the trade-off between permeability and
   selectivity. However, permeance (gas flux), rather than permeability, is
   more emphasized recently because the increase of the real gas flux
   through a membrane without the loss of selectivity has been recognized
   to be more important in industrial scenarios. The permeance is inversely
   proportional to the membrane thickness, and thus the thin film membranes
   with sub-micro scale selective layers as part of a composite membrane
   has drawn particular interests. In thin film membranes, the membrane
   fabrication technique as well as the membrane configuration design are
   more important than the membrane materials. However, the recent progress
   on membrane fabrication techniques, especially the bottom-up approaches
   for composite membranes, have not been fully reviewed and compared. This
   review focuses on the recent progress in fabrication techniques and
   approaches of the thin film (sub-micron) polymeric membranes for CO2
   capture, the state-of-art performance of those membranes will be
   summarized, and future direction of thin film composite membrane will be
   discussed.},

   emerging applications of mussel-inspired coatings in membranes are
   discussed, including as a skin layer in nanofiltration, interlayer in

Abstract = {In order to reduce the fire risk of epoxy resin (EP), functionalized
   reduced graphene oxide (RGO) with Co-ZIF (zeolitic imidazolate
   frameworks-67) adsorbed borate ions (ZIF-67/RGO-B) was prepared. The
   results of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) showed that ZIF-67 was
   grown on the surface of RGO triumphantly. In addition, the structure of
   ZIF-67/RGO-B was not significantly changed compared with ZIF-67/RGO.
   Subsequently, ZIF-67/RGO-B was added into EP by a simple blending
   method. The combustion results showed that the heat and smoke production
   of EP composites were obviously reduced. In particular, compared with
   pure EP, the peak heat release rate (pHRR), the total heat release (THR)
   and the maximum value of smoke density (D-s,D-max) of the composite with
   2 wt\% ZIF-67/RGO-B were reduced by 65.1\%, 41.1\% and 66.0\%,
   respectively. The main mechanism of ZIF-67/RGO-B for reducing the fire
   risk of EP was analyzed according to the results of the char analysis.
   This work provided a new type of modified RGO for reducing the fire
   hazard of EP.},

Abstract = {SDC (Solid desiccant cooling) systems have gained increasing interest as
   an alternative air conditioning technology. Performance of desiccant
   plays a crucial role in overall performance of the whole system,
   especially in terms of dehumidification and regeneration capacity. It is
   desirable to explore desiccant possessing high adsorption capacity and
   good regeneration ability. Thus, this review summarizes recent
   researches and developments on novel solid desiccant materials that can
   be adopted,in SDC systems. The materials include composite desiccants,
   nanoporous inorganic materials and polymeric desiccants. Adsorption
   isotherms are concluded and compared. Regeneration ability is also
   considered for full use of low grade thermal energy. Results show that
   by proper selection of host matrix and immersed salts, composite
   desiccants have improved capacity of dehumidification and regeneration.
   Besides, a good balance can be reached between regeneration and
   adsorption capacity by tailoring textural properties of nanoporous
   inorganic materials. For polymeric desiccants, especially MIL type
   (materials of Institute Lavoisier Frameworks), further progress in
   adsorptive dehumidification will be anticipated. Though some novel
   materials approach requirements for SDC systems, no material currently
   available can perfectly satisfy all the required demands. In this case,
   more intensive researches in the field of development and evaluation of
   advanced materials are still required. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   High Areal Capacity Li Anodes},
Journal = {ADVANCED MATERIALS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {29},
Number = {29},
Month = {AUG 4},
Abstract = {The Li metal anode has long been considered as one of the most ideal
   anodes due to its high energy density. However, safety concerns, low
   efficiency, and huge volume change are severe hurdles to the practical
   application of Li metal anodes, especially in the case of high areal
   capacity. Here it is shown that that graphitized carbon fibers (GCF)
   electrode can serve as a multifunctional 3D current collector to enhance
   the Li storage capacity. The GCF electrode can store a huge amount of Li
   via intercalation and electrodeposition reactions. The as-obtained anode
   can deliver an areal capacity as high as 8 mA h cm(-2) and exhibits no
   obvious dendritic formation. In addition, the enlarged surface area and
   porous framework of the GCF electrode result in lower local current
   density and mitigate high volume change during cycling. Thus, the Li
   composite anode displays low voltage hysteresis, high plating/stripping
   efficiency, and long lifespan. The multifunctional 3D current collector
   promisingly provides a new strategy for promoting the cycling lifespan
   of high areal capacity Li anodes.},

   widely explored, it remains a critical challenge to develop robust and
   highly selective phosphate adsorbents featuring abundant binding sites
   and high affinity. In this work, two stable metal-organic frameworks
   (MOFs) of amine functionalized MIL-101 based on trivalent metal aluminum
   and iron were synthesized by simple solvothermal methods and applied as
   adsorbents to capture phosphate ions of high strength. Phosphate
   adsorption kinetics, isotherm behavior, and solution matrix effects (eg.
   solution pH, coexisting ions and ionic strength) were reported. Results
   showed that trivalent metal based NH2-MIL-101 MOFs outperformed most
   adsorbents ever reported, exhibiting fast kinetics and high maximal
   adsorption capacity above 79.414 mg P/g at 298 K, pH independence in the
   range from 3 to 11, less sensitivity to ion strength, strong selectivity
   for phosphate in presence of competing ions and could be easily
   regenerated and re-applied for phosphate removal. It was noticeable that
   phosphate adsorption performance varied on the two kinds of trivalent
   metals based MOFs due to their difference in morphology, surface and
   interface properties including zeta potential, chemical affinity toward
   target anion and the types of complexation formed with phosphate.
   NH2-MIL-101(Al) showed faster kinetics, while NH2-MIL-101(Fe) has higher
   affinity toward phosphate. Furthermore, based on Fourier transform
   infrared (FTIR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra and zeta
   potential analysis, electrostatic attraction and ligand exchange were
   identified as the main phosphate adsorption mechanisms by
   NH2-MIL-101(Al/Fe). Besides, the functionalized adsorbents with amine
   group further enhanced the phosphate removal capacities by providing
   extra surficial positive charges. These findings demonstrate that
   trivalent metal based NH2-MIL-101 is a promising candidate for phosphate
   adsorption from aqueous solution with high efficiency and selectivity.},

   optimal properties are essential for efficient solar energy-driven
   applications in photocatalysis. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are
   excellent platforms to generate different nanocomposites comprising
   metals, oxides, chalcogenides, phosphides, or carbides embedded in

   attention for atmospheric water harvesting (AWH) applications but suffer
   from the salting-out effect. To this end, this work, for the first time,
   discovers that the salting-in effect possessed by a zwitterionic
   hydrogel is able to facilitate water vapor sorption by the hygroscopic
   salt under otherwise the same conditions. For demonstration,
   zwitterionic hydrogel of
   poly-{[}2-(methacryloyloxy)ethyl]dimethyl-(3-sulfopropyl)ammonium
   hydroxide (PDMAPS) was synthesized, and the hygroscopic salt of LiCl was
   embedded into PDMAPS to produce the salt-hydrogel composite. LiCl salt
   not only endows the sorbent with high water vapor sorption capacity but
   also facilitates the dissociation of self-association between cationic
   and anionic groups of PDMAPS. This salting-in effect was evaluated and
   confirmed experimentally and via density functional theory (DFT)
   calculation. The salting-in effect renders the zwitterionic hydrogel
   matrix with enhanced swelling capacity, leading to the sorbent's high
   AWH performance. With a photothermal component of CNT integrated into
   the sorbent, a fully solar energy-driven AWH process was demonstrated
   outdoors. This study provides important guidance to the design of
   hydrogel-based AWH sorbents.},

Abstract = {We found that the optimized mixture of graphene and multilayer graphene,
   produced by the high-yield inexpensive liquid-phase-exfoliation
   technique, can lead to an extremely strong enhancement of the
   cross-plane thermal conductivity K of the composite. The ``laser
   flash{''} measurements revealed a record-high enhancement of K by 2300\%
   in the graphene-based polymer at the filler loading fraction f = 10 vol
   \%. It was determined that the relatively high concentration of the
   single-layer and bilayer graphene flakes (similar to 10-15\%) present
   simultaneously with the thicker multilayers of large lateral size
   (similar to 1 mu m) were essential for the observed unusual K
   enhancement. The thermal conductivity of the commercial thermal grease
   was increased from an initial value of similar to 5.8 W/mK to K = 14
   W/mK at the small loading f = 2\%, which preserved all mechanical
   properties of the hybrid. Our modeling results suggest that
   graphene-multilayer graphene nanocomposite used as the thermal interface
   material outperforms those with carbon nanotubes or metal nanoparticles
   owing to graphene's aspect ratio and lower Kapitza resistance at the
   graphene-matrix interface.},

   electronics. Here, highly stretchable conductive fiber composed of
   silver nanowires (AgNWs) and silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) embedded in a
   styrene-butadiene-styrene (SBS) elastomeric matrix is fabricated. An
   AgNW-embedded SBS fiber is fabricated by a simple wet spinning method.
   Then, the AgNPs are formed on both the surface and inner region of the
   AgNW-embedded fiber via repeated cycles of silver precursor absorption
   and reduction processes. The AgNW-embedded conductive fiber exhibits
   superior initial electrical conductivity (sigma(0) = 2450 S cm(-1)) and
   elongation at break (900\% strain) due to the high weight percentage of
   the conductive fillers and the use of a highly stretchable SBS elastomer
   matrix. During the stretching, the embedded AgNWs act as conducting
   bridges between AgNPs, resulting in the preservation of electrical
   conductivity under high strain (the rate of conductivity degradation,
   sigma/sigma(0) = 4.4\% at 100\% strain). The AgNW-embedded conductive
   fibers show the strain-sensing behavior with a broad range of applied
   tensile strain. The AgNW reinforced highly stretchable conductive fibers
   can be embedded into a smart glove for detecting sign language by
   integrating five composite fibers in the glove, which can successfully
   perceive human motions.},

Title = {Increased Thermal Conductivity of Eicosane-Based Composite Phase Change
   Materials in the Presence of Graphene Nanoplatelets},

Abstract = {Alkanes and their mixtures (paraffins) have widely been used as phase
   change materials (PCMs) for low-to-medium temperature thermal energy
   storage. Among the various alkanes, eicosane, with a nominal melting
   temperature of 37 degrees C, has emerged in energy-storage-based passive
   thermal management technologies, for electronics for example. In an
   effort to increase the thermal conductivity of eicosane, the effect of
   adding graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs) as thermally conductive nanofillers
   was investigated experimentally. The composite PCM samples were prepared
   by dispersing GNPs in liquid eicosane at various loadings (0, 1, 2, 5,
   and 10 wt.\%) without any surfactants. Thermal conductivity of the
   composite PCM samples in their solid phase was then measured by means of
   the transient plane source technique at elevated temperatures from 10 to
   35 degrees C. Latent heat of fusion and melting point of the samples
   were also characterized using a differential scanning calorimeter. It
   was shown that for the highest loading examined (10 wt.\%), the relative
   thermal conductivity enhancement is above 400\% at 10 degrees C,
   indicating that the emerging GNPs have much better performance than the
   conventional nanofillers attempted in the available literature, such as
   metal/oxide nanoparticles and carbon nanotubes. Reduced thermal
   interface resistance, related to the unique two-dimensional planar
   morphology of GNPs, was interpreted to be responsible for their superior
   performance. The matrix/filler thermal interface resistance was
   estimated to range from 6 x 10(-9) to 9 x 10(-9) m(2) K/W. In contrast
   to the markedly increased thermal conductivity, however, the penalty of
   decrease in the energy storage capacity, caused by the presence of GNPs,
   was shown to be less significant.},

   polymers, the fabrication of high-performance polymer/TiO2 composites is
   still a big challenge. To improve and fully utilize the catalytic
   efficiency of TiO2 for flame retardant application, in this work, a
   hierarchical core-shell TiO2-based architecture was constructed,
   composed by TiO2 nanospheres (core) and oriented-growth Co-Al layered
   double hydroxide (LDH)@Ni (OH)(2) nano-catalyst (shell). As-fabricated
   hybrids with a fine frame construction improved the interfacial
   interaction with unsaturated polyester resin (UPR) matrix, contributed
   by increased contact area and interpenetration between two phases.
   Through well-contacted interface, the external force can be transferred
   smoothly to the rigid filler, and thus improved mechanical performance
   of UPR/TiO2@LDH@Ni(OH)(2) nano composites. Theoretically, the
   well-designed structures and optimization of the chemical composition
   for transition metal compounds are important to effectively reduce fire
   hazards of UPR composites. Compared with pure UPR, the heat release,
   flammable pyrolysis products and toxic smoke emission were clearly
   reduced during the combustion of UPR/TiO2@LDH@Ni(OH)(2), which can be
   attributed to the adsorption effect of core-shell hybrids and the
   barrier effect of thermostable char layers. Moreover, the total CO
   release experienced a maximum 53.33\% decrease. Herein, this work
   expands the thinking of the preparation of multifunctional
   high-performance composites, and designs a novel hierarchical core-shell
   architecture with multiple regularly oriented shell layers.},

   one of the most challenging issues facing the world. Membrane separation
   technology is one of the most cost-effective and widely applied
   technologies for water purification. Polymeric membranes such as
   cellulose-based (CA) membranes and thin-film composite (TFC) membranes
   have dominated the industry since 1980. Although further development of
   polymeric membranes for better performance is laborious, the research
   findings and sustained progress in inorganic membrane development have
   grown fast and solve some remaining problems. In addition to
   conventional ceramic metal oxide membranes, membranes prepared by
   graphene oxide (GO), carbon nanotubes (CNTs), and mixed matrix materials
   (MMMs) have attracted enormous attention due to their desirable
   properties such as tunable pore structure, excellent chemical,
   mechanical, and thermal tolerance, good salt rejection and/or high water
   permeability. This review provides insight into synthesis approaches and
   structural properties of recent reverse osmosis (RO) and nanofiltration
   (NF) membranes which are used to retain dissolved species such as heavy
   metals, electrolytes, and inorganic salts in various aqueous solutions.
   A specific focus has been placed on introducing and comparing water
   purification performance of different classes of polymeric and ceramic

Abstract = {With the development of science and technology, microelectronic
   components have evolved to become increasingly integrated and
   miniaturized. As a result, thermal management, which can seriously
   impact the function, reliability, and lifetime of such components, has
   become a critical issue. Recently, the use of polymerbased thermal
   interface materials (TIMs) in thermal management systems has attracted
   considerable attention in view of the superior comprehensive properties
   of the former. Compared with designing and fabricating a polymer with an
   intrinsically high thermal conductivity, a more effective and widely
   used strategy for improving the heat conductivity is to fill a polymer
   matrix with a thermally conductive filler. Specifically,
   three-dimensional (3D) interconnected heat-conductive networks can
   increase the thermal conductivity (k) of polymers more effectively than
   dispersed fillers can, owing to their intrinsic continuous structures.
   In this review, we first introduce the heat conduction mechanisms and
   the problems associated with polymer-based TIMs fabricated using
   engineering polymer chains and traditional filling methods. Next, we
   discuss the advantages and mechanisms of 3D interconnected
   heat-conductive networks for preparing thermally conductive
   polymer-based composites. In addition, we highlight new advancements in
   the design and fabrication of 3D thermally conductive networks as well
   as their application in improving the k of polymers. Our exhaustive
   review of 3D interconnected networks includes graphene, carbon
   nanotubes, boron nitride, metal and other 3D hybrid architectures. The
   key structural parameters and control methods for improving the thermal
   properties of polymer composites are outlined. Finally, we summarize
   some effective strategies and possible challenges for the development of
   polymer-based thermally conductive composites via integration with 3D

  abstract                   = {Selective Laser Melting (SLM) is a particular rapid prototyping, 3D
   printing, or Additive Manufacturing (AM) technique designed to use high
   power-density laser to melt and fuse metallic powders. A component is
   built by selectively melting and fusing powders within and between
   layers. The SLM technique is also commonly known as direct selective
   laser sintering, LaserCusing, and direct metal laser sintering, and this
   technique has been proven to produce near net-shape parts up to 99.9\%
   relative density. This enables the process to build near full density
   functional parts and has viable economic benefits. Recent developments
   of fibre optics and high-power laser have also enabled SLM to process
   different metallic materials, such as copper, aluminium, and tungsten.
   Similarly, this has also opened up research opportunities in SLM of
   ceramic and composite materials. The review presents the SLM process and
   some of the common physical phenomena associated with this AM
   technology. It then focuses on the following areas: (a) applications of
   SLM materials and (b) mechanical properties of SLM parts achieved in
   research publications. The review is not meant to put a ceiling on the
   capabilities of the SLM process but to enable readers to have an
   overview on the material properties achieved by the SLM process so far.
   Trends in research of SLM are also elaborated in the last section. (C)

  abstract                   = {The allotropes of carbon nanomaterials (carbon nanotubes, graphene) are
   the most unique and promising substances of the last decade. Due to
   their nanoscale diameter and high aspect ratio, a small amount of these
   nanomaterials can produce a dramatic improvement in the properties of
   their composite materials. Although carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and graphene
   exhibit numerous extraordinary properties, their reported
   commercialization is still limited due to their bundle and layer forming
   behavior. Functionalization of CNTs and graphene is essential for
   achieving their outstanding mechanical, electrical and biological
   functions and enhancing their dispersion in polymer matrices. A
   considerable portion of the recent publications on CNTs and graphene
   have focused on enhancing their dispersion and solubilization using
   covalent and non-covalent functionalization methods. This review article
   collectively introduces a variety of reactions (e.g. click chemistry,
   radical polymerization, electrochemical polymerization, dendritic
   polymers, block copolymers, etc.) for functionalization of CNTs and
   graphene and fabrication of their polymer nanocomposites. A critical
   comparison between CNTs and graphene has focused on the significance of
   different functionalization approaches on their composite properties. In
   particular, the mechanical, electrical, and thermal behaviors of
   functionalized nanomaterials as well as their importance in the
   preparation of advanced hybrid materials for structures, solar cells,
   fuel cells, supercapacitors, drug delivery, etc. have been discussed
   thoroughly. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

   detection, localization and quantification in Functionally Graded
   Material (FGM) plate structures. Metal and Ceramic FGM plates are
   considered using three different composite materials: Al/Al2O3,
   Al/ZrO2-1, and Al/ZrO2-2. The FGM plates are modelled using IsoGeometric
   Analysis (IGA), which is more efficient than the classical Finite
   Element Method (FEM). Using a power-law distribution of the volume
   fractions of the plate constituents, the material properties of the
   plates are expected to vary continuously through their thickness.
   Improved damage indicator based on Frequency Response Function (FRF) is
   employed to predict the damaged elements in the first stage. A robust
   and efficient Improved Artificial Neural Network using Arithmetic
   Optimization Algorithm (IANN-AOA) is implemented for damage
   quantification problem in the second stage. The main idea is based on
   eliminating the healthy elements from the numerical model by the
   improved indicator. Next, collected data from damaged element based on
   damage index of an improved indicator is used as input and damage level
   as output. To prove the robustness of IANN-AOA, a Balancing Composite
   Motion Optimization (BCMO) is considered to improve ANN (IANNBCMO) and
   is used for comparison. The results show that the improved indicator can
   predict the damaged elements with high precision. For damage
   quantification, IANN-AOA provides more accurate results than IANNBCMO.},

  abstract                   = {Beyond state-of-the-art lithium-ion battery (LIB) technology with
   metallic lithium anodes to replace conventional ion intercalation anode
   materials is highly desirable because of lithium's highest specific
   capacity (3,860 mA/g) and lowest negative electrochemical potential
   (similar to 3.040 V vs. the standard hydrogen electrode). In this work,
   we report for the first time, to our knowledge, a 3D
   lithium-ion-conducting ceramic network based on garnet-type
   Li6.4La3Zr2Al0.2O12 (LLZO) lithium-ion conductor to provide continuous
   Li+ transfer channels in a polyethylene oxide (PEO)-based composite.
   This composite structure further provides structural reinforcement to
   enhance the mechanical properties of the polymer matrix. The flexible
   solid-state electrolyte composite membrane exhibited an ionic
   conductivity of 2.5 x 10(-4) S/cm at room temperature. The membrane can

Abstract = {Conventional lithium-ion batteries with liquid organic electrolytes
   generally suffer potential security risks concerning volatilization,
   flammability and explosion. Nonflammable and thin solid-state
   electrolytes particularly composite solid electrolytes (CSEs) that
   integrate the merits of different electrolyte systems have attracted
   increasing attention for advanced lithium batteries with improved energy
   density and high safety. In this work, a three-dimensional (3D)
   fiber-network-reinforced CSE, which consists of a mechanically robust,
   porous polyimide (PI) film as a host, Li6.75La3Zr1.75Ta0.25O12 (LLZTO)
   nanoparticles and poly (vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) polymer matrix with
   bis-trifluoromethanesulfonimide lithium salt as electrolyte filler, is
   designed and fabricated. Such unique 3D CSE films with PI fiber network
   holding for uniform dispersion of LLZTO in PVDF show continuous lithium
   ion transfer pathways and effective prevention for lithium dendrite
   growth, consequently exhibiting improved mechanical property (high
   tensile strength of 11.5 MPa) and high cyclic stability (more than 1000
   h of cycling for Li symmetric batteries). Furthermore, solid-state
   LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2/Li pouch cells with the PI-PVDF/LLZTO CSE exhibit
   excellent cyclic stability (152.6 mA h g(-1) with capacity retention of
   94.9\% at 0.1C after 80 cycles) at room temperature, and high
   functionality and safety (withstand harsh environments such as folding,
   cutting and nail penetration) in practical applications.},

  abstract                   = {Electrolytes based on organic solvents used in current Li-ion batteries
   are not compatible with the next-generation energy storage technologies
   including those based on Li metal. Thus, there has been an increase in
   research activities investigating solid-state electrolytes, ionic
   liquids (ILs), polymers, and combinations of these. This Account will
   discuss some of the work from our teams in these areas. Similarly, other
   metal-based technologies including Na, Mg, Zn, and Al, for example, are
   being considered as alternatives to Li-based energy storage. However,
   the materials research required to effectively enable these alkali metal
   based energy storage applications is still in its relative infancy. Once
   again, electrolytes play a significant role in enabling these devices,
   and research has for the most part progressed along similar lines to
   that in advanced lithium technologies. Some of our recent contributions
   in these areas will also be discussed, along with our perspective on
   future directions in this field. For example, one approach has been to
   develop single-ion conductors, where the anion is tethered to the
   polymer backbone, and the dominant charge conductor is the lithium or
   sodium countercation. Typically, these present with low conductivity,
   whereas by using a copolymer approach or incorporating bulky quaternary
   ammonium co-cations, the effective charge separation is increased thus
   leading to higher conductivities and greater mobility of the alkali
   metal cation. This has been demonstrated both experimentally and via
   computer simulations. Further enhancements in ion transport may be
   possible in the future by designing and tethering more weakly
   associating anions to the polymer backbone. The second approach
   considers ion gels or composite polymer electrolytes where a polymerized
   ionic liquid is the matrix that provides both mechanical robustness and
   ion conducting pathways. The block copolymer approach is also
   demonstrated, in this case, to simultaneously provide mechanical
   properties and high ionic conductivity when used in combination with
   ionic-liquid electrolytes. The ultimate electrolyte material that will
   enable all highperformance solid-state batteries will have ion transport
   decoupled from the mechanical properties. While inorganic conductors can
   achieve this, their rigid, brittle nature creates difficulties. On the
   other hand, ionic polymers and their composites provide a rich area of
   chemistry to design and tune high ionic conductivity together with ideal
   mechanical properties.},

Title = {Alginate-templated synthesis of CoFe/carbon fiber composite and the
   effect of hierarchically porous structure on electromagnetic wave
   absorption performance},
Journal = {CARBON},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {151},
Pages = {36-45},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Natural alginate fibers are used as templates to fabricate CoFe
   alloy-decorated hierarchically porous carbon fibers (HPCFs). Due to the
   coordination with negatively charged alpha-L-guluronate blocks,
   transition metal (TM) ions could be confined in the ``egg box{''}
   structure of alginate, which convert to CoFe alloy particles that
   homogenously embedded in HPCFs during carbonization. The composition and
   weight ratio of magnetic particles could be well controlled by adjusting
   the absorbed TM ions and carbonization temperature. Unlike previous
   analogues with uniform mesopores, this composite fiber simultaneously
   possesses a number of mesopores and a high proportion of submicron
   macropores which not only facilitates the accommodation of large-sized
   CoFe particles, but also induces abundant interfacial polarization and
   EMW multi-scattering. Remarkably, the CoFe/HPCF with a filler loading as
   low as 15 wt\% in matrix achieves an extremely strong reflection loss of
   -69.1 dB at a thin thickness of 1.6 mm, and its effective absorption
   bandwidth reaches 5.2 GHz, showing better comprehensive properties than
   other similar absorbers. This work highlights the importance of
   hierarchically porous structure (especially macroporous structure) on
   improving EMW absorption. The synthetic strategy is green, low cost,
   scalable, and can be used to synthesize other highly efficient composite
   absorbers. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   lithium-ion batteries},
Journal = {CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {380},
Month = {JAN 15},
Abstract = {The combination of transitional metal dichalcogenides with MXene is an
   effective strategy to explore high-performance anode materials for
   lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). In this work, SnS2/Sn3S4 hybrid decorated
   on Ti3C2 MXene (S-TC) was prepared through a facile solvothermal and
   calcination process. The multi-layered Ti3C2 matrix improves the
   electron transport capability, inhibits the aggregation and accommodates
   the volume change of SnS2/Sn3S4 hybrid, while the SnS2/Sn3S4 hybrid
   confined in the multilayer stacks serves as a spacer to decrease the
   tendency of layer restacking and improves the limited capacities of
   Ti3C2. Besides, the nano-sized SnS2/Sn3S4 hybrid with high specific
   surface area also enhances the contact between electrolyte and
   electrode. When used as anode for LIBs, S-TC demonstrates a good cycling
   stability (462.3 mAh g at 100 mA g(-1) after 100 cycles) and superior
   rate performance (216.5 mAh g(-1) at 5000 mA g(-1)). The strategy in
   this work should provide a new insight into fabricating novel
   MXene-based anode material for high-rate LIBs.},

   of devices and functional coatings based on Ti3C2Tx remains challenging
   as they are prone to chemical degradation by their oxidation to TiO2. In
   this paper, we examine the oxidation of Ti(3)C(2)T(x )in air, liquid,
   and solid media via conductivity measurements to assess the shelf life
   of Ti3C2Tx MXenes. The oxidation of Ti3C2Tx was observed in all the
   media used in this study, but it is fastest in liquid media and slowest
   in solid media (including polymer matrices). We also show that the
   conventional indicators of MXene oxidation, such as changes in color and
   colloidal stability, are not always reliable. Finally, we demonstrate
   the acceleration of oxidation under exposure to UV light.},

   spheres via electrostatic adsorption. On account of the unique polymeric
   matrix of g-C3N4 and reversible hydrogen bonding, the carbon@g-C3N4
   derived from the sol solution showed high mechanical stability with
   broadened light absorption and enhanced conductivity for charge
   transport. Thus, the carbon@g-C3N4 core shell structure exhibited
   remarkably enhanced photoelectrochemical performance. This polymer
   system is envisaged to hybridize with desirable functionalities (such as

Abstract = {Two-dimensional nanosheets have shown great potential for separation
   applications because of their exceptional molecular transport
   properties. Nanosheet materials such as graphene oxides, metal-organic
   frameworks, and covalent organic frameworks display unique, precise, and
   fast molecular transport through nanopores and/or nanochannels. However,
   the dimensional instability of nanosheets in harsh environments
   diminishes the membrane performance and hinders their long-term
   operation in various applications such as gas separation, water
   desalination, and ion separation. Recent progress in nanosheet membranes
   has included modification by crosslinking and functionalization that has
   improved the stability of the membranes, their separation functionality,
   and the scalability of membrane formation while the membranes' excellent
   molecular transport properties are retained. These improvements have
   enhanced the potential of nanosheet membranes in practical applications
   such as separation processes.},

Title = {Metal-organic framework membranes: Recent development in the synthesis
   strategies and their application in oil-water separation},
Journal = {CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {405},
Month = {FEB 1},
Abstract = {Metal organic frameworks (MOFs), as a new type of organic-inorganic
   composite material, have attracted more and more attention for
   advantageous features, such as large specific surface area, regular and
   adjustable pore structure, good thermal and chemical stability. However,
   the prepared MOFs usually exist in the form of fine powder, which is
   difficult to recycle in the actual industrial field. From the beginning
   of the 21st century, researchers began to pay attention to the
   preparation and application of MOF membranes based on the excellent
   properties of MOFs. In the past ten years, a variety of excellent MOF
   membranes have been successfully prepared and widely used in the fields
   of separation, catalysis, optics, sensing, and metal protection.
   Therefore, this review first classified summarizes the synthesis
   strategies of pure MOF membranes and MOF-based mixed matrix membranes.
   Furthermore, in order to better illustrate the excellent separation
   performance of MOF membranes, the application of MOF membranes in gas
   separation, pervaporation, desalination and water treatment and
   separation are briefly introduced. On this basis, the research progress
   of MOF membranes in the application of oil-water separation is
   emphatically described. Among them, the separation mechanism is
   discussed systematically, and the application status of several commonly
   used separation membranes and MOF membranes in oil water separation are
   compared and discussed. Finally, the research prospects are discussed,
   aiming to provide theoretical basis and technical guidance for realizing
   the large-scale application of MOF membranes in the field of oil-water
   separation.},

Title = {A universal approach to turn UiO-66 into type 1 porous liquids via
   post-synthetic modification with corona-canopy species for CO2 capture},
Journal = {CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL},

Abstract = {Porous liquids (PLs), an emerging class of liquid materials with
   permanent porosity and good fluidity, have shown great potential in gas
   capture and separation. However, directly turning metal?organic
   frameworks (MOFs) into type 1 PLs via post-synthetic modification (PSM)
   strategy with corona-canopy species has not been reported till now.
   Moreover, challenges including reducing the cost and simplifying the
   synthesis process are daunting. In present study, we propose a universal
   approach to turn UiO-66 into PLs via post-synthetic modification
   strategy with core-corona-canopy structure using organosilane (OS)
   corona and oligomer canopy species. The ionically-tethered canopy
   species endow UiO-66 with good liquid-like behaviors at room
   temperature. CO2 and N2 adsorption?desorption behaviors revealed that
   PLs possessed great potential in CO2 selective adsorption separation.
   Meanwhile, the enhanced CO2 selective capture sites were determined. As
   a proof-of-concept, the asprepared UiO-66-liquid-M2070 PL was
   incorporated into Pebax-1657 polymer matrix to prepare mixed matrix
   membranes (MMMs). The excellent dispersion ability, porous structures,
   and corona-canopy species contributed to the enhanced CO2 selective
   permeation. Therefore, the CO2 permeability and CO2/N2 selectivity of
   MMM PUiO-66-liquid-50 increased by 396.5\% and 81.3\%, respectively,
   compared with that of pure Pebax membrane, showing attracting prospect
   in membrane separation. Moreover, the generality of this PSM strategy
   was confirmed using other different types of canopy species. Remarkably,
   this PSM strategy could be applied to synthesize other types of advanced
   porous materials (APMs)-based (e.g., covalent organic frameworks (COFs))
   PLs by utilizing the rich library of oligomer species, thus undoubtedly
   advancing the applications of porous liquids in gas storage and
   separation.},

Title = {Review on nano zerovalent iron (nZVI): From synthesis to environmental
   applications},
Journal = {CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL},

Volume = {287},
Pages = {618-632},
Month = {MAR 1},
Abstract = {For remediation of water and soil, various nanoparticles such as
   zeolites, metal oxides, carbon materials, metals, or bimetallic
   nanoparticles (e.g. Fe/Pd, Fe/Ag) have been reported. However, the most
   extensively applied nanoparticle is nano zerovalent iron (nZVI). It is
   due to properties and effectiveness of nZVI in the removal of pollutants
   as well as its cost effectiveness of production. The aim of this work is
   to present the opportunities and risks arising from the use nZVI from
   its synthesis to environmental application. Compared to the previous
   reviews, our paper shows, a new look on nZVI with the common (e.g.
   milling, chemical reduction) and the latest methods of synthesis (e.g.
   green synthesis, ultrasound or electrochemical method) and modification
   of nZVI, whose number is increasing especially in recent years.
   Therefore, refer to the new trends is very important when selecting nZVI
   for the treatment of various matrices. This review also identifies
   problems that may occurs a result of changes in the physicochemical
   properties of nZVI due to their modification (e.g. other metal doping,
   coating the surface, or deposition on the support). Research shows that
   modifications of the nZVI surface can help in their stabilization,
   reduction of aggregation, and reduction of toxicity. However, the
   improvement of those properties may simultaneously lead to the creation
   of other threats related with the application of nZVI. Finally, we
   present the latest examples of practical utilization of nZVI for the
   remediation of soil and water in large-scale application. Research
   demonstrates that nZVI can be an effective and versatile tool for the
   purification of different matrix and especially groundwater. (C) 2015

  abstract                   = {Surface tension driven transport of liquids on open substrates offers an
   enabling tool for open micro total analysis systems that are becoming
   increasingly popular for low-cost biomedical diagnostic devices. The
   present study uses a facile wettability patterning method to produce
   open microfluidic tracks that - due to their shape, surface texture and
   chemistry - are capable of transporting a wide range of liquid volumes
   (similar to 1-500 mu L) on-chip, overcoming viscous and other opposing
   forces (e.g., gravity) at the pertinent length scales. Small volumes are
   handled as individual droplets, while larger volumes require repeated
   droplet transport. The concept is developed and demonstrated with
   coatings based on TiO2 filler particles, which, when present in adequate
   (similar to 80 wt.\%) quantities within a hydrophobic fluoroacrylic
   polymer matrix, form composites that are intrinsically superhydrophobic.
   Such composite coatings become superhydrophilic upon exposure to UV
   light (390 nm). A commercial laser printer-based photo-masking approach
   is used on the coating for spatially selective wettability conversion
   from superhydrophobic to superhydrophilic. Carefully designed
   wedge-patterned surface tension confined tracks on the open-air devices
   move liquid on them without power input, even when acting against
   gravity. Simple designs of wettability patterning are used on versatile
   substrates (e.g., metals, polymers, paper) to demonstrate complex
   droplet handling tasks, e.g., merging, splitting and metered dispensing,
   some of which occur in 3-D geometries. Fluid transport rates of up to
   350 mu L s(-1) are attained. Applicability of the design on metal
   substrates allows these devices to be used also for other microscale
   engineering applications, e.g., water management in fuel cells.},

   printing (BJ3DP) is a process in which a liquid binder is jetted on
   layers of powdered materials, selectively joined, and then followed by
   densification process. Among AM technologies, binder jetting holds
   distinctive promise because of the possibility of rapid production of
   complex structures to achieve isotropic properties in the 3D printed
   samples. By taking advantage of traditional powder metallurgy, BJ3DP
   machines can produce prototypes in which material properties and surface
   finish are similar to those attained with traditional powder metallurgy.
   Various powdered materials have been 3D printed, but a typical challenge
   during BJ3DP is developing printing and post-processing methods that
   maximize part performance. Therefore, a detailed review of the physical
   processes during 3D printing and the fundamental science of
   densification after sintering and post?heat treatment steps are provided
   to understand the microstructural evolution and properties of binder
   jetted parts. Furthermore, to determine the effects of the binder
   jetting process on metallurgical properties, the role of powder
   characteristics (e.g., morphology, mean size, distribution), printing
   process parameters (e.g., layer thickness, print orientation, binder
   saturation, print speed, drying time), sintering (e.g., temperature,
   holding time), and post-processing are discussed. With the development
   of AM technologies and the need for post-processing in 3D printed parts,
   understanding the microstructural evolution during densification is
   necessary and here, processing steps are explained. Finally,
   opportunities for future advancement are addressed.},

Abstract = {Phase change materials (PCMs) possess very high heat storage capacity
   and are capable of maintaining a constant temperature during phase
   change, which makes them most prominent candidates for solar energy
   storage systems, heating, and cooling systems. The low thermal
   conductivity of PCM results in slow heat transfer and low heat storage
   and release rate, which is a major drawback for their practical
   applications. This review focuses on the enhancement of thermal
   conductivity by the introduction of highly thermally conductive metallic
   and carbon-based nanoparticles, metallic foams, expanded graphite and
   encapsulation of PCM. Carbon-based nanoparticles including carbon fiber,
   carbon nanotubes, and graphene show better performance than metal-based
   nanoparticles due to lower density and better dispersion. The thermal
   conductivity of the composite phase change material (CPCM) depends on
   the shape, size, aspect ratio and concentration of nanoparticles. The
   thermal conductivity of CPCM increases by increasing concentration and
   aspect ratio of the additive. Metallic foam and expanded graphite
   possess high thermal conductivity and good thermo-physical properties
   and also prevent leakage of PCM during phase change. The porosity of
   foam has a huge impact on thermal conductivity than pore size.
   Encapsulated PCM has well-enhanced thermal conductivity and
   long-lifetime due to the high thermal conductive shell which also
   protects the PCM from direct contact with the environment. (C) 2018

   grapefruit peel were synthesized and used for Cu(II) removal from
   aqueous solution. FTIR, SEM-EDS, XRD, TGA and XPS, etc. were applied for
   characterization analysis. The synergistic reinforcing effect of polymer
   matrix and biochar fillers improved the adsorptive, mechanical and
   thermostabilized performance of BPA. Factors like component contents of
   biochar and pectin, pH, contact time, Cu(11) concentration and
   coexisting inorganic salts or organic ligands were systematically
   investigated in batch mode. The adsorption isotherms were fitted well by
   the Freundlich model and the experimental maximum adsorption capacity of
   optimized BPA-9 beads (mass ratio of pectin to alginate = 10:1) with
   0.25\% biochar, was similar to 80.6 mg/g at pH 6. Kinetic process was
   well described by the pseudo-second-order model and film diffusion
   primarily governed the overall adsorption rate, followed by
   intraparticle diffusion. Thermodynamics analysis suggested spontaneous
   feasibility and endothermic nature of adsorption behavior. Moreover, BPA
   also showed better environmental adaptability in the presence of NaCl,
   MgCl2, CaCl2, EDTA-2Na and CA as well as good adsorption potential for
   other heavy metal {[}e.g. Pb(III)]. Crucially, the BPA beads showed good
   regeneration ability after five cycles. All these results indicated the
   potential of BPA for removing heavy metal from water.},

   suitable for structural applications at above 2000 degrees C are
   commonly known as Ultra-High Temperature Ceramics (UHTCs). Several
   transition metal di-borides, possessing the desired combinations of
   thermo-mechanical, physical and chemical properties, form an important
   sub-class of the UHTCs. Over the last couple of decades, there has been
   a growing interest for UHTCs in general, and for the transition metal
   di-borides in particular, due to the increasing demands in hypersonic
   aerospace vehicles, atmospheric re-entry vehicles and energy
   applications. However, problems pertaining to sintering, moderate
   fracture toughness and experimental challenges associated with reliably
   measuring the elevated temperature properties, as well as the properties
   that determine the performances at the actual service conditions, have
   limited their widespread applications. This paper comprehensively
   reviews the various routes/techniques, including the advanced ones, as
   adopted for the synthesis and densification of the di-borides. The
   effects of sinter-additives and reinforcements on the densification,
   microstructure and various properties, including elevated temperature
   properties have been discussed in critical terms. Due attention has been
   paid towards understanding the challenges associated with the
   experimental measurements of the high temperature properties under
   extreme environmental conditions and the very recently developed
   techniques for the same. Some of the existing and futuristic
   applications of transition metal di-borides have also been discussed.
   Finally, the review concludes with an outlook towards some of the
   outstanding issues.},

   tailor the ink for DIW of different classes of materials. Then, the
   diverse applications of DIW ranging from electronics to food to

Abstract = {Herein, a blending solid polymer electrolyte that composed of
   polyethylene oxide (PEO) and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) was prepared
   by a simple solution-casting method, and the effect of different lithium
   salts on electrochemical performance at high operating temperature was
   studied. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and
   differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) tests were performed to reveal
   the physical properties of obtained electrolytes, and electrochemical
   measurements demonstrate that a mixture of different Li salts with
   appropriate ratio in PEO/PVDF (1:1) shows a better property at 60 \&
   DEG;C. The assembled LiFePO4||Li solid cells can reach a specific
   capacity of 160 mAh g(-1) with an ionic conductivity of 9.12 x 10(-5) S
   cm(-1). Contributed to the adopt of dual-salts, a high t(Li-), value of
   0.66 was obtained. It can be seen that the addition of rigid polymer
   into a soft matrix can effectively enhance the mechanical strength of
   solid polymer electrolytes to resist the dimensional loss at high
   temperature, and the mixture Li salts can improve the electrochemical
   properties. As a result, this work can provide a practical solution for
   assembly high safety solid Li metal battery for high temperature.},

  abstract                   = {Novel ultrafiltration-adsorption membranes (UFAMs) were designed via
   decorating the walls of membrane internal pores with polydopamine (PDA)
   nanoparticles for heavy metals removal. Specially, self polymerized
   dopamine solution was penetrated through the polyethersulfone (PES) UF
   membrane from reverse direction (i.e., from bottom to top) by
   circulatory filtration, leading to the formation of a PDA nanoparticle
   coating around the walls of finger-like pores (labeled as PES/PDA-R).
   The conventional PDA-decorated membrane (labeled as PES/PDA-F) prepared
   with forward filtration was used for comparison. The results indicated
   that the introduction of PDA nanoparticles on the walls of internal
   pores endowed the PES/PDA-R membrane with enhanced UF performance and
   remarkable adsorption capacity for heavy metals. PES/PDA-R membrane
   exhibited ascendant bovine serum albumin (BSA) rejection (92.9\%) and
   maintainable pure water flux (166 L/m(2) h). The static adsorption
   capacities for Pb2+, Cd2+ and Cu2+ on PES/PDA-R membranes were 20.23 mg
   Pb/g, 17.01 mg Cd/g and 10.42 mg Cu/g, respectively, which are 1.69,
   2.25 and 1.91 times higher than that of the PES/PDA-F membranes.
   Importantly, dynamic filtration experiments revealed 4.13 times
   adsorption capacity for Pb2+ was achieved on PES/PDA-R membrane over
   PES/PDA-F membrane. The significant enhancement of dynamic adsorption
   capacity on PES/PDA-R membrane is derived from the three dimensional
   distribution of PDA nanoparticles on the cross section of PES membrane
   which provide the more active sites and increase the contact time
   between PDA and metal ions. This novel approach paves a way to design
   specific composite membranes for a cost-effective water treatment.},

Abstract = {Recently, there have been considerable progresses in the development of
   membrane materials for various purposes, which in turn has increased the
   demand for new membranes with modified characteristics. One of the most
   versatile and effective modification approaches is the incorporation of
   metal oxide particles to enhance the performance of the membranes.
   Titanium oxide (TiO2) is one of the most practical nanoparticles which
   offer a promising platform for different applications, e.g. high
   performance catalysis, photocatalysis, and electrocatalysis systems. In
   fact, TiO2 plays an important role in performance development of
   membranes. This review comprehensively discusses TiO2 and its
   application in various aspects of membranes and membrane engineering
   processes. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {A simple and template-free method for preparing three-dimensional (3D)
   porous -Fe2O3@C nanocomposite is reported using an aerosol spray
   pyrolysis technology. The nanocomposite contains inner-connected
   nanochannels and -Fe2O3 nanoparticles (5 nm) uniformly embedded in a
   porous carbon matrix. The size of -Fe2O3 nanograins and carbon content
   can be controlled by the concentration of the precursor solution. The
   unique structure of the 3D porous -Fe2O3@C nanocomposite offers a
   synergistic effect to alleviate stress, accommodate large volume change,
   prevent nanoparticles aggregation, and facilitate the transfer of
   electrons and electrolyte during prolonged cycling. Consequently, the
   nanocomposite shows high-rate capability and long-term cyclability when
   applied as an anode material for Na-ion batteries (SIBs). Due to the
   simple one-pot synthesis technique and high electrochemical performance,
   3D porous -Fe2O3@C nanocomposites have a great potential as anode

Title = {Ultralight and fire-resistant ceramic nanofibrous aerogels with
   temperature-invariant superelasticity},
Journal = {SCIENCE ADVANCES},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {4},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Ultralight aerogels that are both highly resilient and compressible have
   been fabricated from various materials including polymer, carbon, and
   metal. However, it has remained a great challenge to realize high
   elasticity in aerogels solely based on ceramic components. We report a
   scalable strategy to create superelastic lamellar-structured ceramic
   nanofibrous aerogels (CNFAs) by combining SiO2 nanofibers with
   aluminoborosilicate matrices. This approach causes the random-deposited
   SiO2 nanofibers to assemble into elastic ceramic aerogels with tunable
   densities and desired shapes on a large scale. The resulting CNFAs
   exhibit the integrated properties of flyweight densities of >0.15mg
   cm(-3), rapid recovery from 80\% strain, zero Poisson's ratio, and
   temperature-invariant superelasticity to 1100 degrees C. The integral
   ceramic nature also provided the CNFAs with robust fire resistance and
   thermal insulation performance. The successful synthesis of these
   fascinating materials may provide new insights into the development of
   ceramics in a lightweight, resilient, and structurally adaptive form.},

   performances based on multifunctional zeolitic imidazolate framework
   derived nanocontainers},

Abstract = {Zeolitic imidazole framework-8 (ZIF-8) with porous structure,
   pH-response and facile synthesis characteristics, as a molecule delivery
   and stimulus-response nanomaterial, has been widely investigated over
   the past decades. Here, we report for the first time a new corrosion
   inhibitor-encapsulated nano-container (denoted as HMSN-BTA@ZIF-8),
   successfully synthesized using ZIF-8 as self-sacrificial template,
   pH-responsive gatekeeper and interfacial compatibility assistant for
   hollow mesoporous silica nanoparticle (HMSN). Corrosion inhibitors of
   benzotriazole (BTA) are encapsulated in the cavity and mesopores of
   HMSN. The results demonstrate that there are outstanding pH-triggered
   activities to both acidic and alkaline conditions for HMSN-BTA@ZIF-8.
   Rather than physically dispersing nanocontainers in the coating matrix,
   the synthesized HMSN-BTA@ZIF-8 can covalently interact with epoxy resin,
   resulting in superior compatibility and more uniform dispersion behavior
   of nanocontainers in the coatings. Interestingly, the epoxy composite
   coating with HMSN-BTA@ZIF-8 exhibits excellent corrosion protection and
   outstanding self-healing performances, which are well characterized by
   potentiodynamic polarization curves, electrochemical impedance
   spectroscopy (EIS), salt spray test and Scanning Kelvin Probe (SKP)
   technique. The outstanding anticorrosion and impressive self-healing
   properties are attributed to the good compatibility of HMSN-BTA@ZIF-8,
   the hydrophobicity of ZIF-8, higher crosslinking densities, and the
   controllable release of BTA in the epoxy composite coating. It is
   believed that this work is very helpful for extending the service life
   of various anticorrosion coatings.},

   Nanocomposite membranes are a promising modified version of traditional
   polymeric membranes for water treatment, with three main characteristics
   of enhanced permeation, improved rejection and reduced fouling. For
   novel nanocomposite membranes, there is a strong connection between the
   membrane fabrication method, the properties of fabricated membranes, and
   membrane performance. This article, first, reviews the different
   nanocomposite membrane fabrication and modification techniques for mixed
   matrix membranes and thin film membranes for both pressure driven and
   non-pressure driven membranes using different types of nanoparticles,
   carbon-based materials, and polymers. In addition, the advanced
   techniques for surface locating nanomaterials on different types of
   membranes are discussed in detail. The effects of nanoparticle
   physicochemical properties, type, size, and concentration on membranes
   intrinsic properties such as pore morphology, porosity, pore size,
   hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity, membrane surface charge, and roughness
   are discussed and the performance of nanocomposite membranes in terms of
   flux permeation, contaminant rejection, and anti-fouling capability are
   compared. Secondly, the wide range of nanocomposite membrane
   applications, such as desalination and removal of various contaminants
   in water treatment processes, are discussed. Extensive background and
   examples are provided to help the reader understand the fundamental
   connections between the fabrication methods, membrane functionality, and
   membrane efficiency for different water treatment processes.},

Abstract = {Engineering non-precious transition metal (TM)-based electrocatalysts to
   simultaneously achieve an optimal intrinsic activity, high density of
   active sites, and rapid mass transfer ability for the oxygen reduction
   reaction (ORR) remains a significant challenge. To address this
   challenge, a hybrid composite consisting of FexCo alloy nanoparticles
   uniformly implanted into hierarchically ordered macro-/meso-/microporous
   N-doped carbon polyhedra (HOMNCP) is rationally designed. The combined
   results of experimental and theoretical investigations indicate that the
   alloying of Co enables a favorable electronic structure for the
   formation of the {*}OH intermediate, while the periodically
   trimodal-porous structured carbon matrix structure not only provides
   highly accessible channels for active site utilization but also
   dramatically facilitates mass transfer in the catalytic process. As
   expected, the Fe0.5Co@HOMNCP composite catalyst exhibits extraordinary
   ORR activity with a half-wave potential of 0.903 V (vs reversible
   hydrogen electrode), surpassing most Co-based catalysts reported to
   date. More remarkably, the use of the Fe0.5Co@HOMNCP catalyst as the air
   electrode in a zinc-air battery results in superior open-circuit voltage
   and power density compared to a commercial Pt/C + IrO2 catalyst. The
   results of this study are expected to inspire the development of
   advanced TM-based catalysts for energy storage and conversion
   applications.},

Title = {Recent advances in organic-inorganic composite solid electrolytes for
   all-solid-state lithium batteries},
Journal = {ENERGY STORAGE MATERIALS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {34},
Pages = {388-416},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {With excellent safety and potentially high energy density,
   all-solid-state lithium batteries (ASSLBs) are expected to meet the
   needs of large-scale energy storage applications, and widely regarded as
   the next-generation battery technology to replace traditional
   lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). As one of the most important components in
   ASSLBs, solid-state electrolytes (SSEs) are the key to promoting the
   commercialization of ASSLBs. Ideal SSEs should at least possess
   excellent mechanical and electrochemical properties to enable ASSLBs to
   operate safely and stably for a long time at a relatively high rate.
   Unfortunately, solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) and inorganic solid
   electrolytes (ISEs) are excluded because of their significant deficiency
   in electrochemical or mechanical properties. In contrast,
   organic-inorganic composite solid electrolytes (O-ICSEs) derived from
   incorporating inorganic fillers into SPEs can well balance the two
   properties through the synergy between the components, which are the
   most promising candidates for ASSLBs. Therefore, a timely summary of the
   latest research progress in the field of O-ICSEs is of great
   significance for designing O-ICSEs with better performance and early
   realizing the commercialization of ASSLBs. In this review, the
   enhancement mechanisms of the electrochemical performance for O-ICSEs
   are firstly discussed in detail, and the basic characteristics of
   effective fillers are determined. Then the latest research progress in
   recent five years of O-ICSEs based on polyethylene oxide (PEO),
   polyacrylonitrile (PAN) and polycarbonate matrix are highlighted,
   covering various fillers types, rational structural designs and main
   performance parameters. Finally, the existing problems and future
   research directions of O-ICSEs are summarized.},

Abstract = {A novel nanocomposite based on black wattle (BW) tannin and
   nanocellulose was prepared and applied in heavy metal ions adsorptive
   removal from aqueous solutions. Firstly, nanocrystalline cellulose was
   oxidized by sodium periodate to get dialdehyde nanocellulose (DANC). BW
   tannin was then covalently immobilized onto DANC, which was used as both
   the matrix and crosslinker, to obtain tannin-nanocellulose (TNCC)
   composite. The resulting nanocomposite was characterized using FTIR,
   AFM, and TG. The successful immobilization was confirmed by the
   chromogenic reaction between FeCl3 and TNCC and FT-IR analysis. AFM
   images revealed that TNCC was ellipsoidal particles with lengths ranging
   from 100-400 nm. Zeta potential measurement showed that TNCC was
   negative charged at a pH range from 1-12. Compared to the original
   tannin, the thermal stability of TNCC was slightly increased by the
   addition of nanocellulose. TNCC demonstrated the maximum adsorption
   efficiency at pH 2 for Cr(VI) and pH 6 for Cu(II) and Pb(II),
   respectively. The adsorption for these three metal ions followed pseudo
   second order kinetics, indicating the chemisorption nature. The
   adsorption isotherms all fitted well with the Sips model, and the
   calculated maximum adsorption capacities were 51.846 mg g(-1), 53.371 mg
   g(-1) and 104.592 mg g(-1) for Cu(II), Pb(II) and Cr (VI), respectively.

   Superior Reversibility and Rate Capability for Sodium-Ion Batteries},

Abstract = {Metal sulfides are promising anode materials for sodium-ion batteries
   due to their large specific capacities. The practical applications of
   metal sulfides in sodium-ion batteries, however, are still limited due
   to their large volume expansion, poor cycling stability, and sluggish
   electrode kinetics. In this work, a two-dimensional heterostructure of
   CoSx (CoS and Co9S8) quantum dots embedded N/S-doped carbon nanosheets
   (CoSx@NSC) is prepared by a sol-gel method. The CoSx quantum dots are in
   situ formed within ultrafine carbon nanosheets without further
   sulfidation, thus resulting in ultrafine CoSx particle size and embedded
   heterostructure. Meanwhile, enriched N and S codoping in the carbon
   nanosheets greatly enhances the electrical conductivity for the
   conductive matrix and creates more active sites for sodium storage. As a
   result, the hybrid CoSx@NSC electrode shows excellent rate capability
   (600 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 A g(-1) and 500 mAh g(-1) at 10 A g(-1)) and
   outstanding cycling stability (87\% capacity retention after 200 cycles
   at 1 A g(-1)), making it promising as an anode material for
   high-performance sodium-ion batteries. A CoSx@NSC//Na0.44MnO2 full cell
   is demonstrated, and it can deliver a specific capacity of 414 mAh g(-1)
   (based on the mass of CoSx@NSC) at a current density of 0.2 A g(-1).},

  abstract                   = {Lithiumsulfur batteries show fascinating potential for advanced energy
   storage systems due to their high specific capacity, low-cost, and
   environmental benignity. However, the shuttle effect and the
   uncontrollable deposition of lithium sulfide species result in poor
   cycling performance and low Coulombic efficiency. Despite the recent
   success in trapping soluble polysulfides via porous matrix and chemical
   binding, the important mechanism of such controllable deposition of
   sulfur species has not been well understood. Herein, we discovered that
   conductive Magneli phase Ti4O7 is highly effective matrix to bind with
   sulfur species. Compared with the TiO2S, the Ti(4)O7S cathodes exhibit
   higher reversible capacity and improved cycling performance. It delivers
   high specific capacities at various C-rates (1342, 1044, and 623 mAh
   g(-1) at 0.02, 0.1, and 0.5 C, respectively) and remarkable capacity
   retention of 99\% (100 cycles at 0.1 C). The superior properties of
   Ti4O7S are attributed to the strong adsorption of sulfur species on the
   low-coordinated Ti sites of Ti4O7 as revealed by density functional
   theory calculations and confirmed through experimental
   characterizations. Our study demonstrates the importance of surface
   coordination environment for strongly influencing the S-species binding.
   These findings can be also applicable to numerous other metal oxide
   materials.},

Abstract = {In this study, a low pressure-driven ultrafiltration (UF) membrane has
   been developed using cellulose acetate (CA), alpha-aminophosphonate
   modified montmorillonite (MMT) and Ag-TiO2 nanoparticles. The
   characteristics of the developed materials and the performance of the
   fabricated membranes were exhaustively evaluated. FTIR and TGA results
   proved the successful incorporation of alpha-aminophosphonate in the
   montmorillonite (MT), while the XRD results showed that it was
   intercalated into the MT layers. XRD results also showed that only
   silver doped anatase TiO2 (Ag-TiO2 NPs) was obtained in nanosized form
   as inferred from the TEM and XRD micrographs. Compared to neat CA
   membrane, the composite membranes (CMs) exhibited a tremendous high flux
   (up to 400 LMH bar), almost 6-fold increment, and a substantially
   reduced fouling rate. The CMs were durable, behaved as an
   ultrafiltration membrane, and their performance in terms of water and
   protein (BSA) solution permeance, and rejection were comparable to
   commercial UF membranes reported in the literature. The optimum CM
   (CM-6) exhibited a satisfactory efficiency in treating textile
   wastewater and showed an adequate rejection for hazardous contaminants
   (chromium, nickel, lead and fluoride). To sum up, fillers enhanced the
   hydrophilicity, mechanical stability and performance of the fabricated
   membranes. The fabricated membranes in this work showed potentiality for
   hazardous textile wastewater treatment.},

   for flexible and wearable electronics due to their high energy density

   crosslinked solid polymer electrolyte (SPE) with high ion conductivities
   at room temperature (RT), high mechanical strength, and fast interfacial
   charge transport for flexible ASSLBs. The SPE is synthesized by one-step
   in-situ crosslinked polymerization of 1, 3-dioxolane, and
   trimethylolpropane triglycidyl ether within a lithium nitrate-containing
   mesoporous polymer (LP) matrix. The three-dimensional crosslinked
   polymer network enables the composite SPE with high RT ionic
   conductivity of 3.0 x 10(-4) S cm(-1) and improved oxidation stability.
   The LP matrix could promote the formation of hybrid Li3N/LiF interfacial
   layers on both sides of the SPE, resulting in uniform lithium
   deposition. The symmetric cell of Li/SPE/Li can be cycled with an
   extremely small overpotential of 45 mV for 1000 cycles. The integrated
   paper-type pouch cell could retain high capacities retention ( > 90\%),
   negligible voltage fluctuation ( < 50 mV), and high operation safety
   during 2000 cycles of bending (bending radius: 5 mm). This work offers a
   feasible pathway for developing an ultrathin solid-state electrolyte
   with high ionic conductivities, excellent interfacial compatibility, and
   high mechanical robustness for flexible ASSLBs.},

  abstract                   = {Research in stretchable conductors is fuelled by diverse technological
   needs. Flexible electronics, neuroprosthetic and cardiostimulating
   implants, soft robotics and other curvilinear systems require materials
   with high conductivity over a tensile strain of 100 per cent (refs 1-3).
   Furthermore, implantable devices or stretchable displays(4) need
   materials with conductivities a thousand times higher while retaining a
   strain of 100 per cent. However, the molecular mechanisms that operate
   during material deformation and stiffening make stretchability and
   conductivity fundamentally difficult properties to combine. The
   macroscale stretching of solids elongates chemical bonds, leading to the
   reduced overlap and delocalization of electronic orbitals(5). This
   conductivity-stretchability dilemma can be exemplified by liquid metals,
   in which conduction pathways are retained on large deformation but weak
   interatomic bonds lead to compromised strength. The best-known
   stretchable conductors use polymer matrices containing percolated
   networks of high-aspect-ratio nanometre-scale tubes or nanowires to
   address this dilemma to some extent(6-11). Further improvements have
   been achieved by using fillers (the conductive component) with increased
   aspect ratio, of all-metallic composition(12), or with specific
   alignment (the way the fillers are arranged in the matrix)(13,14).
   However, the synthesis and separation of high-aspect-ratio fillers is
   challenging, stiffness increases with the volume content of metallic
   filler, and anisotropy increases with alignment(15). Pre-strained
   substrates(16,17), buckled microwires(18) and three-dimensional
   microfluidic polymer networks(19) have also been explored. Here we
   demonstrate stretchable conductors of polyurethane containing spherical
   nanoparticles deposited by either layer-by-layer assembly or
   vacuum-assisted flocculation. High conductivity and stretchability were
   observed in both composites despite the minimal aspect ratio of the
   nanoparticles. These materials also demonstrate the electronic
   tunability of mechanical properties, which arise from the dynamic
   self-organization of the nanoparticles under stress. A modified
   percolation theory incorporating the self-assembly behaviour of
   nanoparticles gave an excellent match with the experimental data.},

   not been fully exploited owing to intrinsic limitations. Carbon-enriched
   biochar (BC) has been widely used to overcome the limitations of nZVI

   reviews the preparation of nZVI/BC nanocomposites; the effects of BC as
   a supporting matrix on the nZVI crystallite size, dispersion, and
   oxidation and electron transfer capacity; and its interaction mechanisms
   with contaminants. The literature review suggests that the properties
   and preparation conditions of BC (e.g., pore structure, functional
   groups, feedstock composition, and pyrogenic temperature) play important
   roles in the manipulation of nZVI properties. This review discusses the
   interactions of nZVI/BC composites with heavy metals, nitrates, and
   organic compounds in soil and water. Overall, BC contributes to the
   removal of contaminants because it can attenuate contaminants on the
   surface of nZVI/BC; it also enhances electron transfer from nZVI to
   target contaminants owing to its good electrical conductivity and
   improves the crystallite size and dispersion of nZVI. This review is
   intended to provide insights into methods of optimizing nZVI/BC
   synthesis and maximizing the efficiency of nZVI in environmental

Abstract = {In this study, nanocellulose was synthesised by acid hydrolysis of
   cellulose and was coupled with polypyrrole supporting matrix. The
   synthesised nanocellulose polypyrrole composite (NCPPY) was
   characterised by FESEM, XRD, FTIR, BET, TGA/DSC and NMR. These analysis
   showed the conversion of cellulose to nano sized crystalline structure
   with excellent thermal stability and higher surface area. The effect of
   different parameters like pH, temperature, contact time, adsorbent
   dosage and initial concentration of Chromium (Cr(VI)) and Congo Red (CR)
   were optimised in batch mode. Response Surface Methodology (RSM) has
   been employed as an optimization tool for the efficient removal of
   Cr(VI) and CR and the maximum removal efficiency was found to be 80\%
   and 85\% respectively. The Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm well fitted
   the equilibrium data for CR and Cr(Vl) respectively. Thermodynamic data
   showed that the biosorption of Cr(VI) and CR on NCPPY is an endothermic,
   spontaneous, and entropy-driven process. The adsorption kinetic followed
   pseudo-second-order for Cr(VI) and intraparticle diffusion for CR.
   Effect of co-existing ions were checked using several common salts and
   heavy metals. Results indicated that NCPPY has great potential to remove
   Cr(VI) and CR binary mixture under simulated conditions. (C) 2020

Title = {Selective laser melting of 304L stainless steel: Role of volumetric
   energy density on the microstructure, texture and mechanical properties},
Journal = {ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {32},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The role of volumetric energy density on the microstructural evolution,
   texture and mechanical properties of 304L stainless steel parts
   additively manufactured via selective laser melting process is
   investigated. 304L is chosen because it is a potential candidate to be
   used as a matrix in a metal matrix composite with nanoparticles
   dispersion for energy and high temperature applications. The highest
   relative density of 99 \% +/- 0.5 was achieved using a volumetric energy
   density of 1400 J/mm(3). Both XRD analysis and Scheil simulation
   revealed the presence of a small trace of the delta ferrite phase, due
   to rapid solidification within the austenitic matrix of 304L. A fine
   cellular substructure ranged between 0.4-1.8 mu m, was detected across
   different energy density values. At the highest energy density value, a
   strong texture in the direction of {[}100] was identified. At lower
   energy density values, multicomponent texture was found due to high
   nucleation rate and the existing defects. Yield strength, ultimate
   tensile strength, and microhardness of samples with a relative density
   of 99 \% were measured to be 540 +/- 15 MPa, 660 +/- 20 MPa and 254 +/-
   7 HV, respectively and higher than mechanical properties of
   conventionally manufactured 304L stainless steel. Heat treatment of the
   laser melted 304L at 1200 degrees C for 2 h, resulted in the nucleation
   of recrystallized equiaxed grains followed by a decrease in
   microhardness value from 233 +/- 3 HV to 208 +/- 8 HV due to
   disappearance of cellular substructure.},

   from photocatalytic activity of the exposed Ni@UiO-66 on membrane
   surface, the obtained PES-Ni@UiO-66 membrane demonstrated excellent
   photocatalytic self-cleaning ability with a flux recovery rate (FRR)
   higher than 95\% under UV irradiation. Analyzing by extended
   Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (XDLVO) theory indicated that the
   improved antifouling performance could be attributed to less attractive
   or even repulsive interaction between the prepared membrane and
   pollutants. This work provided valuable guidance for structural
   regulation and development of high-performance MOFs-based membranes for
   water treatment. (C) 2022 Published by Elsevier Inc.},

   different industries. Synthetic membranes may be composed of inorganic
   materials (such as ceramics) and organic materials (such as polymers).
   Current research on membranes focus more on polymeric membranes due to
   better control of the pore forming mechanism, higher flexibility,
   smaller spaces required for installation and lower costs compared to
   inorganic membranes. Though polymeric membranes have these properties
   which make them better materials in membrane fabrication, they also have
   some disadvantages which need to be overcome. Common problems faced by
   polymeric membranes, such as high hydrophobicity, exposure to
   biofouling, low fluxes and low mechanical strength have become the focus
   of researchers in order to improve these disadvantages. The
   incorporation of nanoparticles into polymeric membranes has been the
   trend in the field of membrane research recently. Incorporation of
   nano-sized materials could produce synergistic effects when incorporated
   with different types of materials. This paper discusses a few types of
   nanoparticles incorporated into various types of polymeric membranes.
   Nanoparticles that will be discussed include silver, iron, zirconium,
   silica, aluminium, titanium, and magnesium based nanoparticles.
   Nanoparticles affect the permeability, selectivity, hydrophilicity,
   conductivity, mechanical strength, thermal stability, and the antiviral
   and antibacterial properties of the polymeric membranes. Though
   nanoparticles usually improve the performances of the membranes, they
   also might change or even deteriorate the performances of the membranes.
   Thus, careful study needs to be done in order to choose the most
   appropriate types and composition of nanoparticles to be incorporated
   into polymeric membranes. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The advantages of membrane technology over conventional separation
   methods are high removal capacity, flexibility of operation and cost
   effectiveness. However, the main limitation to the greater use of
   membrane technology is membrane fouling. Fouling is the phenomena of
   deposition or adsorption of colloids, particles, biomolecules and
   macromolecules (e.g. proteins, polysaccharides), salts, etc. on the
   membrane surface and/or inside pores and pore walls during filtration.
   This leads to a decline in permeation flux, change in selectivity and
   separability during filtration operation, and reduces membrane life.
   Various studies have concluded that intrinsic hydrophobicity of membrane
   materials is one of the main reasons for fouling. To overcome this
   drawback, various nanocomposite membranes are being tailored to impart
   certain properties such as hydrophilicity, anti-fouling, self-cleaning,
   photocatalytic, and photodegradation. This review is focused on the
   nanocomposite membranes that are made by incorporating nanoparticles
   (NPs) into polymeric membrane matrix by different methods like coating,
   blending, and deposition. Some of the nanocomposite membranes reported
   include metal-based NPs viz. TiO2, SiO2, Al2O3, Si, Ag, ZnO, ZrO2,
   Mg(OH)(2), CaCO3, and TiSiO4; carbon-based NPs viz. graphene oxide (GO)
   and carbon nanotubes (CNTs); and NP composites viz. GO-SiO2, GO-TiO2,
   SiO2-TiO2, and Ag-SiO2. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

   Lac/Cu-MOF were lower than those of Lac/Co-MOF (Km = 0.13 mM, Vmax =
   230.7 mu mol/min). The immobilized laccases showed good reusability as
   well as improved resistance to temperature denaturation and high storage
   stability. For instance, the Lac/Co-MOF and Lac/Cu-MOF retained more
   than 58\% activity after 4 weeks of storage at room temperature.

   eliminating toxic pol-lutants because of their attractive attributes,
   including large specific surface area, ultra-high porosity, abundant
   active adsorption sites, tunable surface chemistry, well-controlled pore
   size distribution, and strong host-guest interactions. Among the many
   developed MOFs, the Zr-based MOFs, particularly the UiO-66 family, are
   considered extremely attractive for wastewater treatment applications.
   The fascinating properties of UiO-66 such as high thermal stability,
   superior chemical resistance towards several solvents, including
   benzene, acetone, different alcohols, dimethylformamide, acidic and
   basic solution, excellent chemical stability against various conditions
   such as air, water, and chloroform, and exceptional resistance to high
   external pressure, mainly due to strong Zr-O bond and high coordination
   number between the Zr clusters and organic ligands have led to numerous
   potential applications in wastewater treatment. This review primarily
   focuses on the latest efforts in applying UiO-66 MOFs as superior
   water-stable MOFs for efficient removal (adsorption/separation and
   degradation/reduction) of various water pollutants, including organic
   dyes, heavy metal ions, pharmaceuticals and personal care products,
   phosphate, and fluoride. The possible adsorption/separation and
   degradation/reduc-tion mechanisms for removing water pollutants by
   UiO-66 and its modified derivatives are fully addressed. Thus, the
   review is expected to provide guidance and stimulate researchers to
   carefully investigate the real applications of UiO-66 MOFs in water and
   wastewater treatment applications.},

   inclusion of graphene nanoplatelets increases the thermal conductivity
   of phase change material by 230\% at a loading of 1 vol\%. Comparing the
   experimental results with the model calculations based on the effective
   medium theory suggests that graphene based nanocomposites outperforms
   those with carbon nanotubes or metal nanoparticles reported in the
   literature. High thermal conductivity, high aspect ratio and low thermal
   interface resistance at the graphene host matrix interface makes it the
   most suitable nano filler candidate to enhance the thermal conductivity
   of low conductive materials. Differential scanning calorimetry study of
   the nanocomposites show that the phase change enthalpy and the melting
   temperature remains similar to that of pristine material, which makes
   graphene a promising candidate for thermal energy storage applications.

   intensive research in optoelectronic applications. To date, most of the
   TADF materials are limited to metal-organic complexes and organic
   molecules with lifetimes of several microseconds/milliseconds that are
   sensitive to oxygen. We report a facial and general
   ``dots-in-zeolites{''} strategy to in situ confine carbon dots (CDs) in
   zeolitic matrices during hydrothermal/solvothermal crystallization to
   generate high-efficient TADF materials with ultralong lifetimes. The
   resultant CDs@zeolite composites exhibit high quantum yields up to
   52.14\% and ultralong lifetimes up to 350 ms at ambient temperature and
   atmosphere. This intriguing TADF phenomenon is due to the fact that
   nanoconfined space of zeolites can efficiently stabilize the triplet
   states of CDs, thus enabling the reverse intersystem crossing process
   for TADF. Meanwhile, zeolite frameworks can also hinder oxygen quenching
   to present TADF behavior at air atmosphere. This design concept
   introduces a new perspective to develop materials with unique TADF
   performance and various novel delayed fluorescence-based applications.},

   electron-withdrawing boron atom in composites can greatly reduce the
   energy gap between the singlet and triplet state; the formed glassy
   state can effectively protect the excited triplet states of CDs from
   nonradiative deactivation. A universal host for embedding CDs to achieve
   long-lifetime and multi-color (blue, green, green-yellow and orange) RTP
   via a low cost, quick and facile process was developed. Based on their

   important tribological applications. This article gives a comprehensive
   review of the recent developments of four typical carbon nanomaterials
   including fullerenes, carbon nanotubes (CNTs), graphene and nanodiamonds
   in tribology. Firstly, the applications of the four types of carbon
   nanomaterials in coatings for anti-wear enhancement and friction
   reduction are discussed. Secondly, the improvement of tribological
   behaviors for bulk materials by using CNTs, graphene and nanodiamonds as
   additives is reviewed. Thirdly, the discussion is conducted on the
   mechanisms of the fullerenes, CNTs, graphene and nanodiamonds acting as
   additives in lubricants to achieve friction and wear reduction.
   Fourthly, the progress on superlubricity using CNTs and graphene is
   highlighted. Finally, this review concludes with an outlook of the
   future studies on carbon nanomaterials in tribology, their key
   challenges for commercial applications, and possible solutions. (C) 2017

   communication tools, it is urgent to design and fabricate low-cost,
   lightweight and effective electromagnetic absorption materials to solve
   electromagnetic interference of electromagnetic wave. Herein, a feasible
   and low-cost method has been developed to synthesize an effective
   carbon-based microwave absorber. The hierarchically porous structures
   derived from eggshell membrane (ESM) and the anchored CoFe2O4
   nanoparticles (NPs) helped the C/CoFe2O4 nanocomposites perform a favor
   for strengthening electromagnetic absorption capability. The porous
   C@CoFe2O4 nanocomposites achieves the maximum reflection loss value of
   -49.6 dB at 9.2 GHz with 30\% loading in the paraffin matrix. Detailed
   investigation reveals that the porous structure as well as strong
   synergetic effect between porous carbon matrix and magnetic
   nanoparticles can effectively improve the impedance matching condition
   and attenuation ability of the nanocomposites, leading to a high
   microwave absorption performance. In addition, the simulation results
   indicate that the radar cross section (RCS) of a strong metal scattering
   sources at different degrees can be significantly reduced after coating
   with C@CoFe2O4 nanocomposites. These achievements light the way to
   prepare low-cost and sustainable microwave absorbents with excellent
   electromagnetic wave absorbing performances, utilizing the wasted
   eggshell membrane biomasses as precursors. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All

   platelets (GPLs) are layer-wise distributed in the matrix either

   multilayer beam model is proposed with material parameters varying
   across layers to achieve graded distributions in both porosity and
   nanofillers. Mechanical properties of closed-cell cellular solids under
   Gaussian Random Field scheme are used to determine the variation of
   Poisson's ratio and the relationship between porosity coefficients and
   mass density. The elastic modulus of the nanocomposite is obtained by
   using Halpin-Tsai micromechanics model. Theoretical formulations are
   based on Timoshenko beam theory and Ritz method is employed to obtain
   the dimensionless fundamental natural frequency and critical buckling
   load of porous nanocomposite beams. A comprehensive parametric study is
   carried out, with a particular focus on the effects of weight fraction,
   distribution pattern, geometry and size of GPL reinforcements on the
   free vibration and buckling behaviors of the nanocomposite beam with
   different metal matrixes and porosity coefficients. The results indicate
   that the effective stiffness of the porous nanocomposite beam can be
   best improved when both porosity distribution and GPL dispersion pattern

Abstract = {Sulfate radical anion (SO4 center dot-) based advanced oxidation
   technologies (AOTs) have received a great deal of attention due to their
   high reactivity with the organic contaminants and high selectivity in
   complex environmental matrices. Among all SO4 center dot- activation
   techniques, the heterogeneous activation of precursor peroxides such as
   peroxymonosulfate (PMS) and persulfate (PS) by nanostructured materials
   has demonstrated to be an effective method to generate SO4 center dot-.
   This paper reviews SO4 center dot- chemistry and the nanostructured
   materials that can effectively activate PMS/PS, namely, transition
   metal-based nano-catalysts, carbon nanomaterials, and nano-composites.
   In addition, we also discuss the activation mechanisms of PMS/PS
   initiated by heterogeneous nanostructured materials, emphasizing their
   catalytic activity, stability, and reusability for the removal of
   organic contaminants. This review shows that nanostructured materials
   have promising potential in environmental remediation based on their
   excellent catalytic efficiency, large specific surface area, and
   controllable structure. It also provides perspective on potential future
   studies on the design of novel nanostructured materials and process
   development in the field of SO4 center dot- based AOTs.},

   the stability, sensitivity and shelf-life of a biosensor. Recently, zinc

   as materials for biosensors due to their biocompatibility, chemical
   stability, high isoelectric point, electrochemical activity, high
   electron mobility, ease of synthesis by diverse methods and high

   biomolecules in desired orientations with improved conformation and high
   biological activity, resulting in enhanced sensing characteristics.
   Furthermore, compatibility with complementary metal oxide semiconductor
   technology for constructing integrated circuits makes ZnO nanostructures
   suitable candidate for future small integrated biosensor devices. This
   review highlights recent advances in various approaches towards
   synthesis of ZnO nanostructures and thin films and their applications in

Abstract = {A new attractive waterborne epoxy (WEP) coating based on aluminum
   dihydric tripolyphosphate/polypyrrole/graphene oxide (ADTP-GO-PPy)
   hybrids was first proposed for the mild steel protection in 3.5\% NaCl
   solution. ADTP-GO-PPy hybrids were synthesized using in situ polymerized
   GO-PPy as a precursor and anchoring lamellar structure of ADTP on the
   surface of GO-PPy nanosheets with the coupling agent 3-aminopropyl
   triethoxysilane (ASi). This induced the superiority improvement in the
   dispersion ability of ADTP-GO-PPy hybrids in WEP matrix due to
   significant increase of interspacing from 0.83 to 1.70 nm. Additionally,
   after decoration by lamellar particles of ADTP, the GO-PPy sheet surface
   was covered by many lamellar particles of ADTP owing to hydrolysis and
   condensation reactions between ASi and oxygen containing groups of
   GO-PPy. Hybrid coating showed clear superiority in improving the
   anticorrosion property, which can be reflected by the morphologies of
   the rust layers beneath WEP coating. The superior corrosion protection
   performance of hybrid coating was attributed to the excellent barrier
   ability of GO nanosheets, self-healing of PPy film, and layer structure
   of ADTP.},

   metal-organic framework (MOF) nanoparticles {[}ZIF-8, MIL-53(Al),
   NH2-MIL-53(Al) and MIL-101(Cr)] in a polyamide (PA) thin film layer were
   synthesized via in situ interfacial polymerization on top of

   homogeneously dispersed in the organic phase containing trimesoyl
   chloride prior to the interfacial reaction, and their subsequent
   presence in the PA layer formed was inferred by a combination of contact
   angle measurements, FT-IR spectroscopy, SEM, EDX, XPS, and TEM. Membrane
   performance in organic solvent nanofiltration was evaluated on the basis
   of methanol (MeOH) and tetrahydrofuran (THF) permeances and rejection of
   styrene oligomers (PS). The effect of different post-treatments and MOF
   loadings on the membrane performance was also investigated. MeOH and THF
   permeance increased when MOFs were embedded into the PA layer, whereas
   the rejection remained higher than 90\% (molecular weight cutoff of less
   than 232 and 295 g.mol(-1) for MeOH and THF, respectively) in all
   membranes. Moreover, permeance enhancement increased with increasing
   pore size and porosity of the MOF used as filler. The incorporation of
   nanosized MIL-101(Cr), with the largest pore size of 3.4 nm, led to an
   exceptional increase in permeance, from 1.5 to 3.9 and from 1.7 to 11.1

Title = {Reduced graphene oxide wrapped MOFs-derived cobalt-doped porous carbon
   polyhedrons as sulfur immobilizers as cathodes for high performance
   lithium sulfur batteries},

Abstract = {Reduced graphene oxide (RGO) wrapped metal-organic frameworks (MOFs)
   derived cobalt doped porous carbon polyhedrons synthesized via a
   carbonization process, are for the first time used for sulfur
   immobilizers (RGO/C-Co-S) as cathodes for high performance
   lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries. The RGO/C-Co-S cathode exhibits greatly
   improved electrochemical performance, showing excellent specific
   capacity of 949 mAh g(-1) at 300th cycle at a current density 0.3 A
   g(-1), displaying enhanced rate capability with specific capacity of
   772, 704 and 606 mAh g(-1) at current density of 0.5, 1 and 2 A g(-1),
   respectively. The synergetic effect of MOFs-derived porous carbon,
   homogeneously distributed Co nanoparticles and RGO nanosheets
   simultaneously contributes to the confinement of sulfur species. The
   presence of abundant mesopores and micropores is conducive to immobilize
   large amounts of S species. The homogenously inlaid ultrafine Co
   nanoparticles can further immobilize sulfur by chemical interactions
   between Co and S/polysulfides. The RGO nanosheets tightly wrapped on
   carbon hosts act as barrier layers to prevent polysulfides from
   diffusing out of the matrix, further suppressing shuttle effect. The
   porous structure and the RGO can effectively alleviate the volume
   changes resulted from charge-discharge process. This design strategy can
   be inspiring for MOF-derived materials in energy storage applications.

Title = {Facile preparation of magnetic Zr-MOF for adsorption of Pb(II) and
   Cr(VI) from water: Adsorption characteristics and mechanisms},
Journal = {CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {415},
Month = {JUL 1},
Abstract = {A novel magnetic Zr-MOF named Ni0.6Fe2.4O4-UiO-66-PEI was synthesized by
   modifying UiO-66-NH2 with Ni0.6Fe2.4O4 and polyethyleneimine and its
   sorption characteristics for two representing heavy metals Pb(II) and
   Cr(VI) in water were examined. This material showed good thermal
   stability and was sufficiently magnetic to allow effective solid-liquid
   separation. The material had a maximum adsorption capacity of 273.2 mg/g
   for Pb(II) at pH 4.0 and 428.6 mg/g for Cr(VI) at pH 3.0, as obtained
   from the model fitting by the Hill equation. The sorption kinetics for
   both heavy metals on the material was fast, with adsorption equilibrium
   established in 60 min and 30 min for Pb(II) and Cr(VI), respectively.
   Model fitting of the kinetic data showed that Pb(II) and Cr(VI) sorption
   on Ni0.6Fe2.4O4-UiO-66-PEI followed the pseudo-second-order model. This
   material had good selectivity for competing ions, and still hold fairly
   good binding capacities after 5 times of regeneration. Adsorption
   mechanisms for Pb(II) and Cr(VI) by Ni0.6Fe2.4O4-UiO-66-PEI were
   proposed by analyzing FTIR, XPS and the electrokinetic property of the
   material. Specifically, Pb(II) adsorption on Ni0.6Fe2.4O4-UiO-66-PEI
   could be attributed to chelation of Pb(II) with the imine/amine
   functional groups in the material's matrix, while Cr(VI) adsorption
   might stem from a combination of electrostatic attraction, chelation and
   redox reaction. It seems that Ni0.6Fe2.4O4-UiO-66-PEI could be used as a
   green and environmental-friendly material for heavy metals removal,
   particularly from acidic water streams.},

Title = {Quantitative X-ray tomography},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL MATERIALS REVIEWS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {59},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-43},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {X-ray computer tomography (CT) is fast becoming an accepted tool within
   the materials science community for the acquisition of 3D images. Here
   the authors review the current state of the art as CT transforms from a
   qualitative diagnostic tool to a quantitative one. Our review considers
   first the image acquisition process, including the use of iterative
   reconstruction strategies suited to specific segmentation tasks and
   emerging methods that provide more insight (e.g. fast and high
   resolution imaging, crystallite (grain) imaging) than conventional
   attenuation based tomography. Methods and shortcomings of CT are
   examined for the quantification of 3D volumetric data to extract key
   topological parameters such as phase fractions, phase contiguity, and
   damage levels as well as density variations. As a non-destructive
   technique, CT is an ideal means of following structural development over
   time via time lapse sequences of 3D images (sometimes called 3D movies
   or 4D imaging). This includes information needed to optimise
   manufacturing processes, for example sintering or solidification, or to
   highlight the proclivity of specific degradation processes under service
   conditions, such as intergranular corrosion or fatigue crack growth.
   Besides the repeated application of static 3D image quantification to
   track such changes, digital volume correlation (DVC) and particle
   tracking (PT) methods are enabling the mapping of deformation in 3D over
   time. Finally the use of CT images is considered as the starting point
   for numerical modelling based on realistic microstructures, for example
   to predict flow through porous materials, the crystalline deformation of
   polycrystalline aggregates or the mechanical properties of composite
   materials.},

   nanocomposite membranes, primarily due to their ultrahigh surface area,
   regular and highly tunable pore structures, and favorable polymer
   affinity. However, the development of engineered MOF-based membranes for
   water treatment lags behind: Here,, thin-film nanocomposite (TFN)
   Membranes containing poly(Sodium 4-styrenesulfonate) (PSS) modified
   ZIF-8 (mZIF) in. a polyamide (PA) layer were constructed via a facile
   interfacial polymerization (IF) method. The modified hydrophilic mZIF
   nanoparticles were evenly dispersed into an aqueous solution comprising
   piperazine (PIP) Monomers, followed by polymerizing with trimesoyl
   chloride (TMC) to form a composite PA film. FTIR spectroscopy and XPS
   analyses confirm the presence of mZIF nanoparticles on the top layer of
   the Membranes. SEM and AFM images, evince a retiform morphology of the
   TNF-mZIF membrane surface, which, is intimately linked to the
   hydrophilicity and adsorption capacity of mZIF nanoparticles.
   Furthermore, the effect of different ZIF-8 loadings on the overall
   membrane performance was studied. Introducing the hydrophilizing mZIF
   nanoparticles not only furnishes the PA layer with a better surface
   hydrophilicity and more negative charge but also more than doubles the
   original water permeability, while maintaining a high retention of
   Na2SO4. The ultrahigh retentions of reactive dyes (e.g.) reactive black
   5 and reactive blue 2, >99.0\%) for mZIF-functionalized PA Membranes
   ensure the superior nanofiltration performance. This facile,
   cost-effective strategy will provide a useful guideline to integrate
   with other modified hydrophilic MOFs to design nanofiltration for water
   treatment.},

Title = {Constructing Ternary CdS-Graphene-TiO2 Hybrids on the Flatland of
   Graphene Oxide with Enhanced Visible-Light Photoactivity for Selective
   Transformation},

Abstract = {The ternary CdS-graphene-TiO2 hybrids (CdS-GR-TiO2) have been prepared
   through an in situ strategy on the flatland of graphene oxide (GO). The
   structure and properties have been characterized by a series of
   techniques, including X-ray diffraction (XRD), field-emission scanning
   electron microscopy (FE-SEM), transmission scanning electron microscopy
   (TEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), UV-vis diffuse
   reflectance spectra (DRS), electrochemical analysis, photoluminescence
   spectra (PL), nitrogen adsorption-desorption, and electron spin
   resonance spectra (ESR). Combined with our previous results, it is found
   that the introduction of the third-component TiO2 can maintain the
   morphology and porosity of the samples, whereas it is able to tune the
   energy band, increase the surface area, and facilitate the electron
   transfer, thus prolonging the lifetime of photogenerated carriers.
   Taking photocatalytic selective oxidation of various alcohols to their
   corresponding aldehydes as model reactions, the ternary CdS-GR-TiO2
   hybrid exhibits enhanced photocatalytic activity compared with its
   foundation matrix binary CdS-GR. The improved photocatalytic performance
   can be attributed to the combined interaction of the longer lifetime of
   photogenerated electron-hole pairs, faster interfacial charge transfer
   rate, and larger surface area. In addition, a possible reaction
   mechanism has been proposed. This work indicates that the careful design
   of graphene-based composites by coupling graphene to suitable, multiple
   semiconductors allows the achievement of more efficient photocatalysts,
   which may have the great potential to improve the capacity for
   photocatalytic processes significantly. As a proof-of-concept, it is
   expected that this work could offer new inroads into exploration and
   utilization of graphene-based nanocomposites as a fertile ground for
   energy conversion.},

   oxide/Fe3O4 nanocomposite (Cs-Bz/ ZnO/Fe3O4) was developed to be a
   promising and recoverable adsorbent for Remazol Brilliant Blue R dye
   (RBBR) removal from the aquatic environment. Parametric optimization by
   Box-Behnken design was made to optimize the synthesis condition (loading
   ZnO nanoparticles into polymeric matrix of Cs) in addition to adsorption
   operation parameters (adsorbent dose, solution pH, temperature, and
   contact time). The obtained results show that the fast RBBR removal
   (98.8\%) can be achieved by loading 25\% ZnO nanoparticles into
   polymeric matrix of Cs (Cs-Bz/ZnO-25/Fe3O4), and at optimum adsorption
   operation parameters (adsorbent dosage of 0.04 g, solution of pH 4,
   temperature of 60 degrees C, and contact time of 10 min). At these
   optimum conditions, the maximum adsorption capacity was found to be
   620.5 mg/g. The best isotherm and kinetic models were Freundlich model
   and pseudo-second-order kinetic model, respectively. The probable RBBR
   dye adsorption mechanism can be assigned to various types of
   physicochemical interactions (i.e; electrostatic, n-pi, pi-pi
   interactions) in addition to hydrogen bonding and Yoshida H-bonding. The
   output of this research confirms that Cs-Bz/ZnO-25/Fe3O4 is a superior,
   recoverable, and environment friendly biohybrid nanocomposite adsorbent.
   The remarkable output of this research can open a window for other
   possible significant applications such as tenement of real waste water,
   removal of heavy metal ions, and reduction of chemical oxygen demand.},

  abstract                   = {The novel idea of alloying, which is based on the utilization of
   multiple principal elements in high concentrations, has created a novel
   class of promising materials called high entropy alloys (HEAs). So far,
   several HEAs with outstanding properties beyond those of conventional
   alloys have been discovered, and new superior high-entropy alloys are
   still expected to be developed in the future. However, the fabrication
   process of HEAs through conventional manufacturing techniques suffers
   from significant limitations due to the intrinsic requirements of HEAs.
   Additive manufacturing (AM), on the other hand, has provided new
   opportunities for fabricating geometrically complex HEAs with the
   possibility of in situ tailoring of their microstructure features.
   Considering the growing interest in AM of HEAs during most recent years,
   this review article aims at providing the state of the art in AM of
   HEAs. It describes the feedstock requirements for laser based AM
   techniques. Thereafter, a comprehensive picture of the current state of
   nearly all HEAs processed by laser metal deposition (LMD), selective
   laser melting (SLM) and selective electron beam melting (SEBM) is
   presented. Special attention is paid to the features of AM derived
   microstructures along with their outstanding properties and underlying
   mechanisms for various material processing combinations. The AM of
   interstitial solute hardening HEAs, HEA matrix composites as well as
   non-beam based AM of HEAs will also be addressed. The post-AM treatments
   and the strategies to fabricate defect-free HEAs are summarized.
   Finally, a conclusion of current state and future prospects of additive
   manufacturing of HEAs will be presented. (C) 2021 Published by Elsevier

  abstract                   = {For the first time, the zeolite-imidazole (ZIF-67) framework, a new
   subfamily of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), is synthesized on the
   graphene oxide (GO) platform. Co2+ (as a central atom) and
   2-methylimidazole (as organic ligands) were assembled to fabricate
   ZIF-67/GO NPs for providing epoxy-based anti-corrosion coatings with
   both active (self-healing) and passive (barrier) performance. Also, the
   ZIF-67/GO NPs were modified by 3-Aminopropyl triethoxysilane (APS) to
   improve the particles compatibility with the epoxy matrix and control
   their solubility in saline media. The FE-SEM, FT-IR, UV-Vis, Raman, TGA,
   and low-angle XRD techniques were used to prove the successful ZIF-67
   particles growth onto the GO platforms. Tafel (potentiodynamic)
   polarization test demonstrated that the ZIF-67/GO@APS NPs could protect
   the surface of steel through mixed anodic/cathodic type (O-2
   reduction/Fe oxidation) mechanisms and the corrosion current density of
   the iron sample decreased to 1.41 mu A.cm(-2). Interestingly, the epoxy
   coatings containing ZIF-67/GO and ZIF-67/GO@APS particles revealed
   long-term corrosion protection durability and outstanding self-healing
   anti-corrosion performance, which were well studied via EIS, salt spray,
   cathodic delamination, and pull-off techniques. The impedance value at
   the lowest frequency for the coating containing ZIF-67/GO@APS after 50
   days decreased from 10.7 Omega.cm(2) to 10.2 Omega.cm(2) that showed the
   lowest reduction among the studied samples.},

Abstract = {Today's power infrastructure involves unpredictability in both demand
   and supply. Power management using energy storage is becoming a
   promising method to have sustainable energy utilization. In recent
   times, energy storage using latent heat thermal energy storage (LHTES)
   technology is receiving more considerable attention to reducing grid
   energy demands. LHTES technology have been utilized by using phase
   change material (PCM)for the last two decades. This review focuses on
   the change in latent heat and thermal conductivity of nanoparticle
   dispersed phase change material (NDPCM) between the operating
   temperature range of 20 degrees C and 37 degrees C as required in
   low-temperature applications. The critical feature of this review is
   that it analyses both the scientific reasons behind the increase or
   decrease in latent heat and thermal conductivity of base PCM. Dispersion
   of nanoparticles as well as supporting materials into the PCM matrix and
   the impact of influencing parameters like size, shape and the material
   of the nanoparticles on the thermal properties of PCM. Dispersion of
   nanoparticle increases, the thermal conductivity gradually increases
   while the latent heat decreases. This indicates that the improvement in
   NDPCM thermal conductivity using nanoparticle will be accompanied by
   reduced latent heat in the NDPCM. However, Thermal conductivity
   enhancement in NDPCM was higher for carbon-based nanomaterial than for
   metal or metal oxide nanomaterial. Thus, the review will be helpful for
   new researchers in understanding the underlying science behind the
   change in critical thermal properties of the base PCM and to further
   improve the performance of the LHTES system.},

  abstract                   = {Developing suitable electrode materials capable of tolerating severe
   structural deformation and overcoming sluggish reaction kinetics
   resulting from the large radius of potassium ion (K+) insertion is
   critical for practical applications of potassium-ion batteries (PIBs).
   Herein, a superior anode material featuring an intriguing hierarchical
   structure where assembled MoSSe nanosheets are tightly anchored on a
   highly porous micron-sized carbon sphere and encapsulated within a thin
   carbon layer (denoted as Cs@MoSSe@C) is reported, which can
   significantly boost the performance of PIBs. The assembled MoSSe
   nanosheets with expanded interlayer spacing and rich anion vacancy can
   facilitate the intercalation/deintercalation of K' and guarantee
   abundant active sites together with a low K' diffusion barrier.
   Meanwhile, the thin carbon protective layer and the highly porous carbon
   sphere matrix can alleviate the volume expansion and enhance the charge
   transport within the composite. Under these merits, the as-prepared
   Cs@MoSSe@C anode exhibits a high reversible capacity (431.8 mAh g(-1) at
   0.05 A g(-1)), good rate capability (161 mAh g(-1) at 5 A g(-1)), and
   superior cyclic performance (70.5\% capacity retention after 600 cycles
   at 1 A g(-1)), outperforming most existing Mo-based S/Se anodes. The
   underlying mechanisms and origins of superior performance are elucidated
   by a set of correlated in-situ/ex-situ characterizations and theoretical
   calculations. Further, a PIB full cell based on Cs@MoSSe@C anode also
   exhibits an impressive electrochemical performance. This work provides
   some insights into developing high-performance PIBs anodes with
   transition-metal chalcogenides. (C) 2022 Science China Press. Published

  abstract                   = {Mg and its alloys have been identified as promising bone implant
   materials owing to their natural degradability, good biocompatibility
   and favorable mechanical properties. Nevertheless, the too fast
   degradation rate usually results in a premature disintegration of
   mechanical integrity and local hydrogen accumulation, which limit their
   clinical bone repair application. In this work, the current research
   status regarding Mg bone implants was systematically reviewed. The
   relevant strategies to enhance the corrosion resistance, including
   purification, alloying treatment, surface coating and Mg-based metal
   matrix composite, are comprehensively discussed. The fabricating
   techniques for Mg bone implants are also presented. Particularly, laser
   additive manufacturing can fabricate customized shape and complex porous
   structure basing on its unique additive manufacturing concept. More
   importantly, it can achieve rapid heating and cooling due to the
   characteristics of high laser energy density and good controllability,
   thereby regulating the microstructure and performance. Furthermore, the
   current challenges and future research perspectives are put forward.
   This work aims to offer some meaningful guidelines for researchers on
   the future study of Mg bone implants. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by

  abstract                   = {Ionic liquids (ILs) have been widely investigated as novel solvents,
   electrolytes, and soft functional materials. Nevertheless, the
   widespread applications of ILs in most cases have been hampered by their
   liquid state. The confinement of ILs into nanoporous hosts is a simple
   but versatile strategy to overcome this problem. Nanoconfined ILs
   constitute a new class of composites with the intrinsic chemistries of
   ILs and the original functions of solid matrices. The interplay between
   these two components, particularly the confinement effect and the
   interactions between ILs and pore walls, further endows ILs with
   significantly distinct physicochemical properties in the restricted
   space compared to the corresponding bulk systems. The aim of this
   article is to provide a comprehensive review of nanoconfined ILs. After
   a brief introduction of bulk ILs, the synthetic strategies and
   investigation methods for nanoconfined ILs are documented. The local
   structure and physicochemical properties of ILs in diverse porous hosts
   are summarized in the next sections. The final section highlights the
   potential applications of nanoconfined ILs in diverse fields, including
   catalysis, gas capture and separation, ionogels, supercapacitors,
   carbonization, and lubrication. Further research directions and
   perspectives on this topic are also provided in the conclusion.},

   are effective antimicrobials in the form of salts, oxides, and colloids,

   are incorporated for food preservation purposes and to decontaminate
   surfaces in industrial environments. Other relevant properties in active
   food packaging, such as the capability for ethylene oxidation or oxygen
   scavenging, can be used to extend food shelf-life. Silver based
   nano-engineered materials are currently the most commonly used in
   commodities due to their antimicrobial capacity. Copper, zinc and
   titanium nanostructures are also showing promise in food safety and
   technology. The antimicrobial properties of zinc oxide at the nanoscale
   will provide affordable and safe innovative strategies. Copper has been
   shown to be an efficient sensor for humidity, and titanium oxide has
   resistance to abrasion and UV-blocking performance. The migration of
   cations from the polymer matrices is the key point to determine their
   antimicrobial effectiveness; however, this cation migration may affect
   legal status of the polymer as a food-contact material.},

   The CA is one of the first materials used to fabricate filtration

   researcher's attention again. This review is focused on the properties
   of cellulose derivatives and especially CA membranes in the fabrication
   of polymeric separation membranes in various applications such as
   filtration, gas separation, adsorption, and ion exchange membranes.
   Firstly, a brief introduction of CA properties and used molecular
   weights in the fabrication of membranes will be presented. After that,
   different configurations of CA membranes will be outlined, and the
   performance of CA membranes in several applications and configurations
   as the main polymer and as an additive in the fabrication of other

   water splitting applications. Microscopic analyses clearly showed the
   formation of Mo2C embedded MoSe2 hybrid nanoarray structured morphology
   composed of nanosized spherical grains with plenty of active sites.
   Improved surface area, modified morphology, highly conductive nature,
   and abundant active sites were obviously confirmed for the MoSe2-Mo2C
   hybrid. Interestingly, MoSe2-Mo2C hybrid nanoarrays exposed excellent
   capacitance with superior rate capability behavior and outstanding
   hydrogen evolution activity with their low overpotential, small Tafel

Abstract = {Lightweight and compressible electromagnetic interference (EMI)
   shielding polymer nanocomposites are urgently required to solve
   increasingly serious electromagnetic pollutions. Two-dimensional
   transition metal carbides and nitrides (MXenes), especially Ti3C2Tx, are
   ideal candidates for constructing highly efficient conduction networks
   in polymer matrices due to their intriguing layered structure and high
   electrical conductivity. Herein, compressible and electrically
   conductive polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)-coated MXene foams are fabricated
   by preforming three-dimensional (3D) MXene aerogel architectures
   assisted with sodium alginate (SA) followed by coating a thin layer of
   PDMS to enhance structural stability and durability of the porous
   architectures. Consequently, the lightweight MXene/SA hybrid aerogel
   achieves an outstanding conductivity of 2211 Sm-1 and a high average EMI
   shielding efficiency of 70.5 dB. Furthermore, the PDMS coating
   effectively endows the 3D conductance network with excellent
   compressibility and durability. The PDMS-coated MXene foam with 6.1 wt\%
   of MXene reserves its high EMI shielding efficiency of 48.2 dB after 500
   compression-release cycles. The lightweight, compressible and conductive
   PDMS-coated MXene foam is thus promising for applications in EMI
   shielding gaskets, wearable electronics, sensors and other specific
   areas.},

Abstract = {Super-wetting MOFs@graphene hybrid has shown promising application for
   oil/water separation, due to high porosity, low density, and
   controllable wettability, however, achieving excellent stability and
   recyclability are found to be still challenging. In this study,
   sandwich-like UIO-66-F-4@rGO hybrid was synthesized by immobilization of
   UIO-66-F-4 nanoparticles on rGO matrix, which featured the unique
   micro/nano hierarchy with hydrophobic characteristics. In order to
   realize the oil/water separation, as-prepared sandwich-like
   UIO-66-F-4@rGO hybrid was applied as a potential candidate for
   constructing robust super-hydrophobic/super-oleophilic interfaces by
   using filter paper (FP) and melamine sponge (MS) as substrates.
   Typically, the surface modification of substrates can be easily achieved
   by simple dip-coating method, and interfacial adhesion between
   substrates and UIO-66-F-4@rGO was enhanced by cross-linking of
   hydroxyl-fluoropolysiloxane (FPSO). Consequently, the
   super-hydrophobic/oleophilic UIO-66-F-4@rGO/FP exhibited high contact
   angle of 169.3 +/- 0.6 degrees and was capable of separating various
   water-in-oil emulsions effectively. The flux and separation efficiency
   were 990.45 +/- 36.28 Lm(-2)h(-1) and 99.73 +/- 0.19 \% driven by
   gravity, respectively. The super-hydrophobic/super-oleophilic
   UIO-66-F-4@rGO/MS possessed selective oil absorption with absorption
   capacity of 26-61 g/g depending on the viscosity of oils and continuous
   cleaning of oil spill. Furthermore, the UIO-66-F-4@rGO composite could
   tolerate high/low temperature, corrosive solutions, and physical damage,
   displaying robust and stable super-hydrophobic/super-oleophilic
   interfaces for treating oily wastewater in harsh environments.},

Abstract = {Developing inexpensive and efficient electrocatalysts for hydrogen
   evolution reaction (HER) during alkaline water electrolysis is crucial
   for renewable and sustainable energy harvesting. Herein, we report a
   novel hybrid electrocatalyst comprising atomically dispersed Ni-N-x
   species anchored porous carbon (Ni-N-C) matrix with embedded Ni
   nanoparticles for HER. This new catalyst is synthesized via pyrolysis of
   hydrothermally prepared supermolecular composite of dicyandiamide and Ni
   ions followed by an acid etching treatment. The achieved hybrid exhibits
   superior catalytic performance toward HER with a small overpotential of
   147 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a low Tafel slope of 114 mV dec(-1),
   comparable to those of state-of-the-art heteroatom-doped nanocarbon
   catalysts and even outperforming other reported transition-metal-based
   compounds in basic media. Experimental observations and theoretical
   calculations reveal that the presence of Ni nanoparticles can optimize
   surface states of Ni-N-x active centers and reduce energy barriers of
   dissociated water molecules, which synergistically improve OH-
   adsorption and promote HER kinetics. When served as electrodes for both
   cathode and anode, an alkaline water electrolyzer could afford a current
   density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a low cell voltage of 1.58 V, rivalling the
   sufficiently high overpotentials of integrated Pt/C-Ir/C benchmark
   electrodes.},

Abstract = {Despite the recent considerable progress, the reversibility and cycle
   life of silicon anodes in lithium-ion batteries are yet to be improved
   further to meet the commercial standards. The current major industry,
   instead, adopts silicon monoxide (SiOx, x approximate to 11), as this
   phase can accommodate the volume change of embedded Si nanodomains via
   the silicon oxide matrix. However, the poor Coulombic efficiencies (CEs)
   in the early period of cycling limit the content of SiOx, usually below
   10 wt \% in a composite electrode with graphite. Here, we introduce a
   scalable but delicate prelithiation scheme based on electrical shorting
   with lithium metal foil. The accurate shorting time and voltage
   monitoring allow a fine-tuning on the degree of prelithiation without
   lithium plating, to a level that the CEs in the first three cycles reach
   94.9\%, 95.7\%, and 97.2\%. The excellent reversibility enables robust
   full-cell operations in pairing with an emerging nickel-rich layered
   cathode, Li{[}Ni0.8Co0.15Al0.05] O-2, even at a commercial level of
   initial areal capacity of 2.4 mAh cm(-2), leading to a full cell energy
   density 1.5-times as high as that of graphite-LiCoO2 counterpart in
   terms of the active material weight.},

   method to enable next-generation wearable electronic devices, touch
   screens, and soft robotics. Both elasticity and self-healing are
   important qualities for substrate materials as they comprise the
   majority of device components. However, most autonomous self-healing
   materials reported to date have poor elastic properties, i.e., they
   possess only modest mechanical strength and recoverability. Here, a
   substrate material designed is reported based on a combination of
   dynamic metal-coordinated bonds (beta-diketone-europium interaction) and
   hydrogen bonds together in a multiphase separated network. Importantly,
   this material is able to undergo self-healing and exhibits excellent
   elasticity. The polymer network forms a microphase-separated structure
   and exhibits a high stress at break (approximate to 1.8 MPa) and high
   fracture strain (approximate to 900\%). Additionally, it is observed
   that the substrate can achieve up to 98\% self-healing efficiency after
   48 h at 25 degrees C, without the need of any external stimuli. A
   stretchable and self-healable dielectric layer is fabricated with a
   dual-dynamic bonding polymer system and self-healable conductive layers
   are created using polymer as a matrix for a silver composite. These
   materials are employed to prepare capacitive sensors to demonstrate a
   stretchable and self-healable touch pad.},

Title = {A critical review of powder-based additive manufacturing of ferrous

Journal = {MATERIALS \& DESIGN},

Volume = {144},

Abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM) is an advanced manufacturing technology,
   enabling production of complex shapes by adding material
   layer-upon-layer, as distinct from conventional subtractive, forming and
   other manufacturing approaches. Thus far, several metallic materials
   including different types of ferrous alloys have been additively
   manufactured to full density with better or equivalent properties
   compared to counterparts made by conventional methods. In this
   perspective, this review article presents different powder-based
   additive manufacturing processes deployed to ferrous alloys, their key
   process parameters, phase transformation and microstructure development
   during solidification, all of which impact on mechanical behavior. The
   article enlightens the basics of Laser Powder-Bed (LPB, also known as
   selective laser melting), Laser Powder-Fed (LPF) and Binder Jetting (BJ)
   AM processes. These processes involve a sequence of complex/rapid
   thermal cycle and solidification behavior that influence the development
   of microstructure and eventually control the mechanical properties. A
   thorough discussion on mechanical behaviors, i.e., hardness, tensile,
   and cyclic/fatigue properties of AM manufactured steels is also
   presented based on several combined process parameters. (C) 2018

Title = {A comprehensive review on water remediation using UiO-66 MOFs and their
   derivatives},
Journal = {CHEMOSPHERE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {302},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are a versatile class of porous
   materials offering unprecedented scope for chemical and structural
   tunability. On account of their synthetic versatility, tunable and
   exceptional host-guest chemistry they are widely utilized in many
   prominent water remediation techniques. However, some of the MOFs
   present low structural stabilities specifically in aqueous and harsh
   chemical conditions which impedes their potential application in the
   field. Among the currently explored MOFs, UiO-66 exhibits structural
   robustness and has gained immense scientific popularity. Built with a
   zirconium-terephthalate framework, the strong Zr-O bond coordination
   contributes to its stability in aqueous, chemical, and thermal
   conditions. Moreover, other exceptional features such as high surface
   area and uniform pore size add to the grand arena of porous
   nanomaterials. As a result of its stable nature, UiO-66 offers relaxed
   admittance towards various functionalization, including synthetic and
   post-synthetic modifications. Consequently, the adsorptive properties of
   these highly stable frameworks have been modulated by the addition of
   various functionalities. Moreover, due to the presence of catalytically
   active sites, the use of UiO-66 has also been extended towards the
   degradation of pollutants. Furthermore, to solve the practical handling
   issues of the crystalline powdered forms, UiO-66 has been incorporated
   into various membrane supports. The incorporation of UiO-66 in various
   matrices has enhanced the rejection, permeate flux, and anti-fouling
   properties of membranes. The combination of such exceptional
   characteristics of UiO-66 MOF has expanded its scope in targeted
   purification techniques. Subsequently, this review highlights the role
   of UiO-66 in major water purification techniques such as adsorption,
   photocatalytic degradation, and membrane separation. This comprehensive
   review is expected to shed light on the existing developments and guide
   the inexhaustible futuristic scope of UiO-66 MOF.},

Title = {In situ synthesis of In2S3@MIL-125(Ti) core-shell microparticle for the
   removal of tetracycline from wastewater by integrated adsorption and
   visible-light-driven photocatalysis},
Journal = {APPLIED CATALYSIS B-ENVIRONMENTAL},

Month = {JUN 5},
Abstract = {Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have been attracted considerable
   attention in the field of energy generation and environmental
   remediation. In this article, a novel core-shell In2S3@MIL-125(Ti) (MLS)
   photocatalytic adsorbent was successfully prepared by a facile
   solvothermal method. The as-obtained materials were characterized by
   scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray
   diffraction, N-2 adsorption-desorption isotherm, X-ray photoelectron
   spectroscopy, UV-vis diffuse reflection spectroscopy and zeta
   potentials. It is indicated that the hybrids consisted of MIL-125(Ti) as
   the core and three-dimensional In2S3 sheets network as the shell has
   high surface area, mesoporous structure, and improved electronegativity
   and visible-light absorption. The MLS exhibited excellent adsorption
   performance for the removal of tetracycline (TC) from water. The
   adsorption process is sensitive to the solution pH, ionic strength and
   initial TC concentration. The Langmuir isotherm and pseudo-second-order
   mode could well describe the adsorption process and adsorption kinetics.
   The adsorption mechanism is mainly responsible for surface complexation,
   pi-pi interactions, hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions.
   Further, in TC degradation experiments under visible light exposure in
   presence of core-shell MIS, the optimal additive content of MIL-125(Ti)
   in synthesis process was 0.1 g, and the corresponding photodegradation
   efficiency for TC was 63.3\%, which was higher than that of pure In2S3
   and pure MIL-125(Ti). The improved photocatalytic performance was mainly
   ascribed to the opened porous structure, effective transfer of
   photo-generated carriers, Ti3+-Ti4+ intervalence electron transfer and
   the synergistic effect between MIL-125(Ti) and In2S3. The degradation
   by-products of TC molecules were monitored by three-dimensional
   excitation-emission matrix fluorescence spectroscopy. Parts of TC
   molecules were mineralized into CO2 and H2O. The core-shell MLS
   composites also revealed good performance for the removal of TC from
   real wastewater including medical wastewater, municipal wastewater and
   river water. Therefore, the novel hybrids may be used as promising
   photocatalytic adsorbent for wastewater purification. (C) 2015 Elsevier

  abstract                   = {The vapor phase interfacial polymerization is the new method for the
   development of thin-film nanocomposite (TFN) and thin-film composite
   (TFC) membranes. Generally, interfacial polymerization (IP) is done
   between aqueous phase monomers and organic phase monomers (containing
   organic solvent like n-hexane) but in this work, IP was done between
   aqueous phase monomer with vapour phase of organic monomer (TMC) which
   is the greener method. First time TFN membranes were prepared by vapour
   phase interfacial polymerization method. TiO2 nanoparticles act as very
   good nanofillers to prepare the polymeric nanocomposite membranes to
   tackle the problem of heavy metal pollution in water. However, their
   weak interaction with the matrix phase is an issue that causes them to
   leach out during the filtration process of pressure-driven
   nanofiltration membrane. Functionalizing the TiO2 nanoparticles with
   polar functional groups is a solution to this issue. After synthesizing
   carboxylic acid-functionalized TiO2 (COOH-TiO2) nanoparticles were
   incorporated in the TFN membranes while IP using DETA and TMC containing
   amine and acyl group monomers, respectively to modify the membrane
   surface. The effect of different loading concentrations of COOH-TiO2
   nanoparticles in TFN has been studied and compared with the TFC
   membrane. The prepared membranes are subjected to a cross-filtration
   system for removing Na+, Cu+2, Hg+2, and Pb+2 from their respective
   Na2SO4, CuSO4, HgCl2, and Pb(NO3)(2) feed solutions. The results of TFN
   membranes were compared with the TFC membrane. The outcomes have shown
   87.03 +/- 2\% rejection of Na+, 86.89 +/- 2\% rejection of Cu+2, 77.01
   +/- 2\% rejection of Hg+2 and 83.42 +/- 1.5\% rejection of Pb+2 ions by
   using TFN membranes. The effect of the monomeric concentration on the
   performance of the developed membranes was also studied. The antifouling
   tendency of the membranes was analysed as well by measuring different
   antifouling parameters like total fouling (FT), flux recovery ratio
   (FRR), reversible fouling (FR) and irreversible fouling (FIR). The
   results obtained are outstanding; incorporating nanomaterial results in
   lowering the irreversible fouling and enhancing the antifouling
   tendency.},

Abstract = {Transition metal phosphides have been extensively investigated owing to
   their high theoretical capacities and relatively low intercalation
   potentials vs Li/Li+, but their practical applications have been
   hindered by low electrical conductivity and dramatic volume variation
   during cycling. In this work, an interesting strategy for the rational
   design of graphene (GR) encapsulated with a hollow FeP@carbon
   nanocomposite (H-FeP@C@GR) via a combination of a hydrothermal route, a
   carbon-coating process, phosphidation treatment, and carbothermic
   reaction is reported. The hollow FeP (H-FeP) nanospheres shelled with
   thin carbon layers are wonderfully incorporated into the GR matrix,
   interconnecting to form a three-dimensional (3D) hierarchical
   architecture. Such a design offers distinct advantages for FeP-based
   anode materials for both lithium ion batteries (LIBs) and sodium ion
   batteries (SIBs). For example, the 3D omnibearing conductive networks
   from the GR skeleton and outer coating carbon can provide an open
   freeway for electron/ion transport, promoting the electrode reaction
   kinetics. In addition, the wrapping of an H-FeP nanosphere in a thin
   carbon layer enables the formation of a solid electrolyte interphase
   (SEI) on the carbon layer surface instead of on the individual H-FeP
   surface, preventing the continual re-forming of the SEI. When used as
   anode materials for LIBs and SIBs, H-FeP@C@GR exhibited excellent
   electrochemistry performances.},

Abstract = {Simulation of temperature evolution and thermal behaviour of the molten
   pool during selective laser melting (SLM) of TiC/AlSi10Mg nanocomposites
   was performed, using a finite volume method. Some important physical
   phenomena, such as a transition from powder to solid, nonlinearities
   produced by temperature-dependent material properties and fluid flow,
   were taken into account in the calculation. The effects of Marangoni
   convection and SLM processing parameters, such as laser power and scan
   speed, on temperature evolution behaviour, molten pool dimensions and
   liquid lifetime were thoroughly investigated. The simulation results
   showed that Marangoni convection played a crucial role in intensifying
   the convective heat transfer and changing the molten pool geometry. The
   temperature of laser-powder interaction zone, the molten pool dimensions
   and liquid lifetime increased with increasing laser power or decreasing
   scan speed. The maximum temperature gradient within the molten pool
   increased significantly with increasing the applied laser power, but
   increased slightly as a higher scan speed was applied. The experimental
   study on the interlayer bonding and densification behaviour and the
   surface morphologies and balling effect of the SLM-processed
   TiC/AlSi10Mg nanocomposites parts was performed. The experimental
   results validated the thermal behaviour and underlying physical
   mechanism of the molten pool obtained in the simulations.},

   possess extraordinary mechanical, physical, and chemical properties
   incomparable to traditional alloys. Nowadays, these alloys exhibit great
   potential for industrial applications due to the developments of
   ultra-superior HEAs. Due to the certain inherent limitations in the
   conventional processing routes of HEAs, the additive manufacturing (AM)
   of these alloys has been rapidly emerging in recent years. Laser-aided
   additive manufacturing (LAAM) of HEAs, through selective laser melting
   (SLM) and direct laser deposition (DLD), is expediting a renaissance in
   the material science field, with the prime focus on the fabrication of
   highly complex HEA parts with tailorable microstructures and mechanical
   properties. The review provides critical and in-depth details of
   laser-based technologies vastly applied for printing HEA products.
   Powder processing routes affect particle morphologies and the
   distribution of particle size. Additionally, the elemental composition
   of additively manufactured (AM-ed) HEAs plays an important role in the
   mechanical characteristics of 3D-printed parts. Furthermore,
   post-processing strategies help in mitigating residual stresses and
   other HEA defects. Compared to conventional manufacturing routes, HEAs
   printed through SLM and DLD technologies exhibited better mechanical
   characteristics due to rapid cooling rates. It is anticipated that AMed
   HEAs will be practically applied to manufacture large-scale and complex
   3D industrial products, which will ultimately help in developing
   3D-printed HEAs for industries.},

Title = {Facile mercury detection and removal from aqueous media involving ligand
   impregnated conjugate nanomaterials},
Journal = {CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {290},
Pages = {243-251},
Month = {APR 15},
Abstract = {The conjugate nanomaterial (CNM) was prepared by sulfur donor containing
   organic ligand onto the silica substrate for simultaneous mercury
   (Hg(II)) ions detection and removal from water samples through a batch
   technique. The potential and feasibility of the CNM as Hg(II) ions
   selective materials were evaluated in terms sensitivity, selectivity
   both in the detection and removal operations. In detection, the
   absorbance spectra increment was linear with the Hg(II) ions
   concentration in low concentration area, and the detection limit of the
   CNM was 0.26 mu g/L. In addition, the colorimetric changes were
   extremely specific for Hg(II) ions, and no significant color change was
   evident in case of other competing metal ions in the sample matrix. In
   removal, the optimization of experimental conditions, including effect
   of pH, equilibrium time, initial Hg(II) ion concentration was examined.
   Due to the strong interaction between Hg(II) ions and sulfur atoms of
   the active surface, the CNM exhibited high adsorption capacity and
   excellent selectivity during Hg(II) adsorption. The experimental results
   showed that the solution pH had a major impact for Hg(II) adsorption by
   the CNM. The experimental data were well fitted with the linear form of
   Langmuir model the maximum adsorption capacity of Hg(II) ions was 164.22
   mg/g. The Hg(II) loaded CNM could be successfully desorbed with 0.20 M
   HCl solution, and the adsorption capacities were not decreased sharply
   even after six cycles showing the practical significance in remediation
   of Hg(II) contaminated wastewater. In addition, the present approach has
   the advantages of sensitivity, selectivity, rapidity, simplicity, and
   low cost for Hg(II) detection and removal, and the newly developed assay
   might open a new assay avenue for Hg(II) ions contaminated water
   treatment. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {An advanced CoSe embedded within porous carbon polyhedra hybrid for high
   performance lithium-ion and sodium-ion batteries},
Journal = {CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {325},
Pages = {14-24},
Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {A novel composite containing CoSe and porous carbon polyhedra (PCP),
   denoted as CoSe@PCP, was successfully synthesized using Co-based
   zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF-67) as precursor through a two-step
   method, including carbonization of ZIF-67 and subsequent selenization.
   The field-emission scanning electron microscopy and transmission
   electron microscopy characterizations confirm that CoSe nanoparticles
   are uniformly dispersed in PCP. When the CoSe@PCP was used as anode
   material for lithium-ion batteries, it exhibits superior performance
   with a high reversible capacity of 675 mAh g(-1) at 200 mA g(-1) after
   100 cycles and 708.2 mAh g(-1) at 1 A g(-1) after 500 cycles as well as
   excellent cycling stability. Additionally, the CoSe@PCP also
   demonstrates excellent performance as anode material for sodium-ion
   batteries. A reversible capacity of 341 mAh g(-1) can be obtained over
   100 cycles at 100 mA g(-1) with high cycling stability. The excellent
   battery performance of CoSe@PCP should be attributed to the synergistic
   effect of nanostructured CoSe and PCP derived from ZIF-67, in which the
   nanostructured CoSe possesses high reactivity towards lithium and sodium
   ions and the PCP can provide a continuous conductive matrix to
   facilitate the charge transfer and an effective buffering to mitigate
   the structure variation of CoSe during cycling. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

   (Ni-CoP) were embedded in amorphous carbon matrix and then anchored on
   the surface of CNTs. The ZIF-67 derived Ni-CoP@C combined with the CNT
   skeleton, which rendered the composite with high specific surface area,
   rich interior porosity and continuous conducive network. This allows
   effective charge transfer, efficient buffering of interior stress, and
   therefore full exertion of the phosphide's pseudocapacitive performance.
   The Ni-doping was achieved by a facile solution-based ion exchange
   process of ZIF-67 at room temperature, which, according to the first
   principle calculations, was helpful to increase the ratio of free
   electrons in Ni-CoP to contribute to higher charge transmission behavior
   in electrochemical reactions. Due to the above characteristics, the
   Ni-CoP@C@CNT electrode exhibited a high specific capacitance of 708.1 F
   g(-1) at 1 A g(-1), which is almost fourfold compare to CoP@C (349.2 F
   g(-1) at 1 A g(-1)). The ASC advice based on Ni-CoP@C@CNT can achieve a
   high energy density of 17.4 Wh kg(-1) at the power density of 699.1 W
   kg(-1) and excellent electrochemical cycling stability with a high
   capacitance retention of 117\%. The Ni-CoP@C@CNT have great potential

Abstract = {Magnesium is one of the largely available elements in the earth's crust.
   It has a low structural density with high specific strength. This unique
   material property has forced an increase in the use of magnesium and its
   alloys in various applications pertaining to industrial sector,
   automobiles, aerospace and biomedical. Since magnesium is a highly
   reactive metal, it is prone to higher rate of corrosion as compared to
   its counterparts. Thus, it is essential to analyze the corrosion
   behavior of magnesium and its alloys in its applications. An appropriate
   process is to be followed in the design and development of magnesium
   alloys which overcome the limitations of magnesium and enhance the
   desired material properties in accordance to their applications. This
   review paper summarizes the importance of magnesium and its material
   properties. The influence of various alloying elements on the mechanical
   properties of magnesium is reviewed. The broad classification of Mg
   alloys and their behavioral trends are detailed. The corrosion behavior
   of magnesium and the influence of corrosion products on the material
   characteristics of magnesium, in aqueous medium, are discussed. The
   manufacturing techniques of magnesium alloys along with the secondary
   techniques are also covered. The various applications and the
   limitations of magnesium in these applications are covered. A complete
   section is dedicated towards detailing the recent trends of magnesium
   (Mg) alloys, i.e., the biodegradable nature and applications of Mg
   alloys. The influence of biocorrosion on Mg alloys and techniques to
   overcome it have been deliberated. This paper provides a thorough review
   on recent developments of magnesium with respect to engineering
   applications. (c) 2021 Chongqing University. Publishing services

Title = {In-situ encapsulation of Ni3S2 nanoparticles into N-doped interconnected
   carbon networks for efficient lithium storage},
Journal = {CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {378},
Month = {DEC 15},
Abstract = {Due to the conversion reaction induced high specific capacity, low cost
   and rich types, the interest on transition metal sulfides for efficient
   lithium storage has grown. Unfortunately, the intrinsically poor
   electrical conductivity and structure instability restrict their
   practical applications. Herein, an in-situ encapsulation strategy is
   developed to prepare the Ni3S2 nanoparticles encapsulated in
   interconnected N-doped porous carbon (Ni3S2@NC) through a facile
   freeze-drying approach and subsequent in-situ conversion. When evaluated
   as anode material for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), the as-prepared
   Ni3S2@NC exhibits a remarkable lithium storage performance, including
   high reversible capacity (1335.4 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles at 0.1 A
   g(-1)), superior rate capability (507.7 mAh g(-1) at 4 A g(-1)) and
   excellent long-term cycling stability (961.4 mAh g(-1) after 600 cycles
   at 0.5 A g(-1) and 862.8 mAh g(-1) after 600 cycles at 1 A g(-1)),
   displaying one of the best lithium storage performances among the
   Ni3S2-based electrodes reported by now. Such an excellent lithium
   storage performance should be attributed to the unique structure
   advantages of Ni3S2@NC inherited from the in-situ encapsulation
   strategy, such as tight combination, increased electrical conductivity,
   shortened ion diffusion distance and buffering matrix provided by
   N-doped porous carbon networks. Importantly, the facile design and
   engineering strategy should also be applied to explore other
   nanoarchitectures to boost their lithium storage performances.},

Title = {Additive-manufactured (3D-printed) electrochemical sensors: A critical
   review},

Abstract = {Additive manufacturing or three-dimensional (3D)-printing is an emerging
   technology that has been applied in the development of novel materials
   and devices for a wide range of applications, including Electrochemistry
   and Analytical Chemistry areas. This review article focuses on the
   contributions of 3D-printing technology to the development of
   electrochemical sensors and complete electrochemical sensing devices.
   Due to the recent contributions of 3D-printing within this scenario, the
   aim of this review is to present a guide for new users of 3D-printing
   technology considering the required features for improved
   electrochemical sensing using 3D-printed sensors. At the same time, this
   is a comprehensive review that includes most 3D-printed electrochemical
   sensors and devices already reported using selective laser melting (SLM)
   and fused deposition modeling (FDM) 3D-printers. The latter is the most
   affordable 3D-printing technique and for this reason has been more often
   applied for the fabrication of electrochemical sensors, also due to
   commercially-available conductive and non-conductive filaments. Special
   attention is given to critically discuss the need for the surface
   treatment of FDM 3D-printed platforms to improve their electrochemical
   performance. The insertion of biochemical and chemical catalysts on the
   3D-printed surfaces are highlighted as well as novel strategies to
   fabricate filaments containing chemical modifiers within the polymeric
   matrix. Some examples of complete electrochemical sensing systems
   obtained by 3D-printing have successfully demonstrated the enormous
   potential to develop portable devices for on-site applications. The
   freedom of design enabled by 3D-printing opens many possibilities of
   forthcoming investigations in the area of analytical electrochemistry.

Title = {Advances, challenges, and perspectives of biogas cleaning, upgrading,
   and utilisation},
Journal = {FUEL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {317},
Month = {JUN 1},
Abstract = {Biogas as a renewable energy resource can be broadly recognised as a
   carbon-neutral fuel which reduces anthropogenic greenhouse gas
   emissions, mitigates global warming, and diversifies energy supply.
   However, the biogas share in the global renewable energy supply chain
   and technology deployment and maturity are not commensurate with the
   potential. The first half of this study critically reviews state of the
   art developments in biogas cleaning and upgrading technologies by
   considering their present status, current challenges, and barriers
   associated with their future development. The second part of this paper
   aims to address critical gaps in con-verting biogas to biomethane,
   proposing required pre-treatment steps for different technologies. The
   third part focuses on current policies concerning the strict regulations
   implemented for flaring consent applications. In this section, biogas
   upgrading technologies were compared by estimating the global warming
   potential (GWP) resulting from waste gases (WG). It was observed that
   due to high methane losses, WGs from membrane tech-nologies have the
   highest GWP, but with flaring have the lowest GWP. In the last part of
   this review, the recent applications of biogas in cogeneration (CHP),
   tri-generation (CCHP), quad-generation systems, heat, and vehicles are
   discussed. The use of biogas by different technologies, and their
   resulting efficiencies were analysed in CHP applications, including
   microturbines, micro humid air turbine (mHAT), solid oxide fuel cells
   (SOFC) and hybrid systems of SOFC-microturbines.},

  abstract                   = {Rechargeable battery systems, including Li-ion batteries and Na-ion
   batteries, have attracted great interest in energy storage because of
   their high energy density, low cost, efficient energy storage and
   suitable redox potential. Nevertheless, their rapid development is still
   greatly hampered by some typical constraints including low coulombic
   efficiency, large volume changes and severe particle agglomeration and
   pulverization during the charge-discharge process. Here, we fabricate a
   few-layer MoSe2 confined within a ZnSe-C hollow porous sphere
   nanocomposite through a simple self-assembly strategy followed by
   selenization, which efficiently circumvents these problems. The
   fabricated ZnSe/MoSe2@C electrode demonstrates diverse advantages,
   including the existence of a few-layer structure, an in situ porous
   carbon matrix, multicomponent coordination and excellent
   pseudocapacitive behavior. When used as an anode material, it displays
   extraordinarily attractive electrochemical performance for both
   lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) and sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). The
   reversible capacity of ZnSe/MoSe2@C for LIBs reaches as high as 1051 mA
   h g(-1) at 0.2 A g(-1) (150 cycles). A long-term high-rate cycling test
   reveals an excellent stability of 524 mA h g(-1) at 4 A g(-1) after 600
   cycles. In addition, for SIBs, ZnSe/MoSe2@C also manifests a high
   initial coulombic efficiency of 89\% at 0.2 A g(-1) and a remarkable
   reversible capacity of 381 mA h g(-1) at a high current density of 4 A
   g(-1) even after 250 cycles with negligible capacity loss. This is one
   of the best performances of ZnSe-based anode materials for SIBs reported
   so far. The regulation strategy reported in the present work is expected
   to offer new insights into the fabrication of high performance anode
   materials for SIBs.},

Title = {Catalytic Conversion of Nonfood Woody Biomass Solids to Organic Liquids},
Journal = {ACCOUNTS OF CHEMICAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2014},

Abstract = {CONSPECTUS: This Account outlines recent efforts in our laboratories
   addressing a fundamental challenge of sustainability chemistry, the
   effective utilization of biomass for production of chemicals and fuels.
   Efficient methods for converting renewable biomass solids to chemicals
   and liquid fuels would reduce society's dependence on nonrenewable
   petroleum resources while easing the atmospheric carbon dioxide burden.
   The major nonfood component of biomass is lignocellulose, a matrix of
   the biopolymers cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin. New approaches are
   needed to effect facile conversion of lignocellulose solids to liquid
   fuels and to other chemical precursors without the formation of
   intractable side products and with sufficient specificity to give
   economically sustainable product streams.
   We have devised a novel catalytic system whereby the renewable
   feedstocks cellulose, organosolv lignin, and even lignocellulose
   composites such as sawdust are transformed into organic liquids. The
   reaction medium is supercritical methanol (sc-MeOH), while the catalyst
   is a copper-doped porous metal oxide (PMO) prepared from inexpensive,
   Earth-abundant starting materials. This transformation occurs in a
   single stage reactor operating at 300-320 degrees C and 160-220 bar. The
   reducing equivalents for these transformations are derived by the
   reforming of MeOH (to H-2 and CO), which thereby serves as a ``liquid
   syngas{''} in the present case. Water generated by deoxygenation
   processes is quickly removed by the water gas shift reaction. The
   Cu-doped PMO serves multiple purposes, catalyzing substrate
   hydrogenolysis and hydrogenation as well as the methanol reforming and
   shift reactions. This one-pot ``UCSB process{''} is quantitative, giving
   little or no biochar residual.
   Provided is an overview of these catalysis studies beginning with
   reactions of the model compound dihydrobenzofuran that help define the
   key processes occurring. The initial step is phenyl ether bond
   hydrogenolysis, and this is followed by aromatic ring hydrogenation. The
   complete catalytic disassembly of the more complex organosolv lignin to
   monomeric units, largely propyl-cyclohexanol derivatives is then
   described. Operational indices based on H-1 NMR analysis are also
   presented that facilitate holistic evaluation of these product streams
   that within several hours consist largely of propyl-cyclohexanol
   derivatives. Lastly, we describe the application of this methodology
   with several types of wood (pine sawdust, etc.) and with cellulose
   fibers. The product distribution, albeit still complex, displays
   unprecedented selectivity toward the production of aliphatic alcohols
   and methylated derivatives thereof. These observations clearly indicate
   that the Cu-doped solid metal oxide catalyst combined with sc-MeOH is
   capable of breaking down the complex biomass derived substrates to
   markedly deoxygenated monomeric units with increased hydrogen content.
   Possible implementations. of this promising system on a larger scale are
   discussed.},

  abstract                   = {The last decade has seen a significant growth in the market for alloys
   used for implants, especially for those intended for orthopedic
   implants. Research into biodegradable magnesium-based alloys has made
   great strides in this period, so huge progress has been made in their
   use in the medical industry. The important factors that led to the
   intensification of research in this regard, were social but also
   economic, wanting to improve the quality of life, by reducing the use of
   conventionally permanent metallic implants (stainless steel,
   cobalt-based alloys, and titanium alloys) which involve the second
   implant removal surgery and other undesirable effects (stress shielding
   and metal ion releases), with a negative impact on the emotional and
   physical condition of patients, and by significantly reducing the costs
   for both the patient and the health system in the field of orthopedics.
   This paper refers to the impact and importance of biodegradable Mg
   alloys, reviewing the beginning of their development, the significant
   characteristics that make them so desirable for such applications
   (orthopedic implants) but also the characteristics that must be
   modulated (corrosion rate and mechanical properties) to arrive at the
   ideal product for the targeted application. It highlights, in detail,
   the mechanism and aspects related to the corrosion behaviour of Mg
   alloys, electrochemical characterization techniques / methods, as well
   as strategies to improve the corrosion behaviour and mechanical
   properties of these types of biodegradable alloys. The means of
   optimization, the category and the effect of the alloying elements, the
   design criteria, the requirements that the implants of biodegradable
   alloys Mg-based must meet and the aspects related to their efficiency
   are also presented. Finally, the potential applications in the
   specialized clinics, as well as the final products currently used and
   made by important prestigious companies in the world are approached. (C)

  abstract                   = {Triboelectrification is an effect that is known to each and every one
   probably since ancient Greek time, but it is usually taken as a negative
   effect and is avoided in many technologies. We have recently invented a
   triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) that is used to convert mechanical
   energy into electricity by a conjunction of triboelectrification and
   electrostatic induction. As for this power generation unit, in the inner
   circuit, a potential is created by the triboelectric effect due to the
   charge transfer between two thin organic/inorganic films that exhibit
   opposite tribo-polarity; in the outer circuit, electrons are driven to
   flow between two electrodes attached on the back sides of the films in
   order to balance the potential. Since the most useful materials for TENG
   are organic, it is also named organic nanogenerator, which is the first
   using organic materials for harvesting mechanical energy. In this paper,
   we review the fundamentals of the TENG in the three basic operation
   modes: vertical contact-separation mode, in-plane sliding mode, and
   single-electrode mode. Ever since the first report of the TENG in
   January 2012, the output power density of TENG has been improved 5
   orders of magnitude within 12 months. The area power density reaches 313
   W/m(2), volume density reaches 490 kW/m(3), and a conversion efficiency
   of similar to 60\% has been demonstrated. The TENG can be applied to
   harvest all kinds of mechanical energy that is available but wasted in
   our daily life, such as human motion, walking, vibration, mechanical
   triggering, rotating tire, wind, flowing water, and more. Alternatively,
   TENG can also be used as a self-powered sensor for actively detecting
   the static and dynamic processes arising from mechanical agitation using
   the voltage and current output signals of the TENG, respectively, with
   potential applications for touch pad and smart skin technologies. To
   enhance the performance of the TENG, besides the vast choices of
   materials in the triboelectric series, from polymer to metal and to
   fabric, the morphologies of their surfaces can be modified by physical
   techniques with the creation of pyramid-, square-, or hemisphere-based
   micro- or nanopatterns, which are effective for enhancing the contact
   area and possibly the triboelectrification. The surfaces of the
   materials can be functionalized chemically using various molecules,
   nanotubes, nanowires, or nanoparticles, in order to enhance the
   triboelectric effect. The contact materials can be composites, such as
   embedding nanoparticles in a polymer matrix, which may change not only
   the surface electrification but also the permittivity of the materials
   so that they can be effective for electrostatic induction. Therefore,
   there are numerous ways to enhance the performance of the TENG from the
   materials point of view. This gives an excellent opportunity for
   chemists and materials scientists to do extensive study both in the
   basic science and in practical applications. We anticipate that a better
   enhancement of the output power density will be achieved in the next few
   years. The TENG is possible not only for self-powered portable
   electronics but also as a new energy technology with potential to
   contribute to the world energy in the near future.},

  abstract                   = {Increased use of reconstruction procedures in orthopedics, due to
   trauma, tumor, deformity, degeneration and an aging population, has
   caused a blossom, not only in surgical advancement, but also in the
   development of bone implants. Traditional synthetic porous scaffolds are
   made of metals, polymers, ceramics or even composite biomaterials, in
   which the design does not consider the native structure and properties
   of cells and natural tissues. Thus, these synthetic scaffolds often
   poorly integrate with the cells and surrounding host tissue, thereby
   resulting in unsatisfactory surgical outcomes due to poor corrosion and
   wear, mechanical mismatch, unamiable surface environment, and other
   unfavorable properties. Musculoskeletal tissue reconstruction is the
   ultimate objective in orthopedic surgery. This objective can be achieved
   by (i) prosthesis or fixation device implantation, and (ii) tissue
   engineered bone scaffolds. These devices focus on the design of
   implants, regardless of the choice of new biomaterials. Indeed, metallic
   materials, e.g. 316L stainless steel, titanium alloys and cobalt
   chromium alloys, are predominantly used in bone surgeries, especially in
   the load-bearing zone of prostheses. The engineered scaffolds take
   biodegradability, cell biology, biomolecules and material mechanical
   properties into account, in which these features are ideally suited for
   bone tissue repair and regeneration. Therefore, the design of the
   scaffold is extremely important to the success of clinical outcomes in
   musculoskeletal surgeries.
   The ideal scaffolds should mimic the natural extracellular matrix (ECM)
   as much as possible, since the ECM found in natural tissues supports
   cell attachment, proliferation, and differentiation, indicating that
   scaffolds should consist of appropriate biochemistry and
   nano/micro-scale surface topographies, in order to formulate favorable
   binding sites to actively regulate and control cell and tissue behavior,
   while interacting with host cells. In addition, scaffolds should also
   possess a similar macro structure to what is found in natural bone. This
   feature may provide space for the growth of cells and new tissues, as
   well as for the carriers of growth factors. Another important concern is
   the mechanical properties of scaffolds. It has been reported that the
   mechanical features can significantly influence the osteointegration
   between implants and surrounding tissues, as well as cell behaviors.
   Since natural bone exhibits super-elastic biomechanical properties with
   a Young's modulus value in the range of 1 similar to 27 GPa, the ideal
   scaffolds should mimic strength, stiffness and mechanical behavior, so
   as to avoid possible post-operation stress shielding effects, which
   induce bone resorption and consequent implant failure. In addition, the
   rate of degradation and the by-products of biodegradable materials are
   also critical in the role of bone regeneration. Indeed, the mechanical
   integrity of a scaffold will be significantly reduced if the degradation
   rate is rapid, thereby resulting in a pre-matured collapse of the
   scaffold before the tissue is regenerated. Another concern is that the
   by-products upon degradation may alter the tissue microenvironment and
   then challenge the biocompatibility of the scaffold and the subsequent
   tissue repair. Therefore, these two factors should be carefully
   considered when designing new biomaterials for tissue regeneration. To
   address the aforementioned questions, an overview of the design of ideal
   biomimetic porous scaffolds is presented in this paper. Hence, a number
   of original engineering processes and techniques, including the
   production of a hierarchical structure on both the macro- and
   nano-scales, the adjustment of biomechanical properties through
   structural alignment and chemical components, the control of the
   biodegradability of the scaffold and its by-products, the change of
   biomimetic surface properties by altering interfacial chemistry, and
   micro- and nano-topographies will be discussed. In general, the concepts
   and techniques mentioned above provide insights into designing superior
   biomimetic scaffolds for bone tissue engineering. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

However, the tribological behavior of these MMCs depend upon various factors which are classified into three categories such as, reinforcement material (size, shape, volume fraction, and type of reinforcement), operating conditions (normal load and sliding speed) and environmental conditions (temperature and relative humidity).

  abstract       = {The Master-alloy (MA) alloy route to promote a liquid phase during sintering has great potential to reduce costs in low alloyed sintered steels, meanwhile enabling the introduction of innovative alloy systems with Cr, Mn and Si. However, in order to successfully modify the performance of steels, multi requirements must be met, including, for example, solubility with the base material, compatibility with the usual sintering atmospheres, homogeneous distribution of the powdered master alloy in the material and the control of secondary porosity. Efforts have been made to properly design the composition of MA, to identify the reducing agents and to understand how they affect the wetting and liquid spreading all over the sintered part. This work reviews these key aspects for the efficient development of steels and explores the possibility to achieve a composition that can act as liquid former or as sinter braze adapting its use to the component requirement.},
